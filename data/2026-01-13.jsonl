To handle spatial data, many data structures, called spatial indexes, have been proposed, e.g. kd-trees, oct/quadtrees (also called Orth-trees), R-trees, and bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs). In real-world applications, spatial datasets tend to be highly dynamic, requiring batch updates of points with low latency. This calls for efficient parallel batch updates on spatial indexes. Unfortunately, there is very little work that achieves this.\n  In this paper, we systematically study parallel spatial indexes, with a special focus on achieving high-performance update performance for highly dynamic workloads. We select two types of spatial indexes that are considered optimized for low-latency updates: Orth-tree and R-tree/BVH. We propose two data structures: the P-Orth tree, a parallel Orth-tree, and the SPaC-tree family, a parallel R-tree/BVH. Both the P-Orth tree and the SPaC-tree deliver superior performance in batch updates compared to existing parallel kd-trees and Orth-trees, while preserving better or competitive query performance relative to their corresponding Orth-tree and R-tree counterparts. We also present comprehensive experiments comparing the performance of various parallel spatial indexes and share our findings at the end of the paper."}

Users can express an operation in natural language (e.g., \"identify if this review mentions billing issues\"), with the system executing the operation on each document, in a row-by-row fashion. One way to reduce cost on a batch of documents is to employ the model cascade framework: a cheap proxy model processes each document, and only uncertain cases are escalated to a more accurate, expensive oracle. However, model cascades miss important optimization opportunities; for example, often only part of a document is needed to answer a query, or other related, but simpler operations (e.g., \"is the review sentiment negative?\", \"does the review mention money?\") can be handled by cheap models more effectively than the original operation, while still being correlated with it.\n  We introduce the task cascades framework, which generalizes model cascades by varying not just the model, but also the document portion and operation at each stage. Our framework uses an LLM agent to generate simplified, decomposed, or otherwise related operations and selects the most relevant document portions, constructing hundreds of candidate tasks from which it assembles a task cascade. We show that optimal cascade selection is intractable via reduction from Minimum Sum Set Cover, but our iterative approach constructs effective cascades. We also provide an extension that offers statistical accuracy guarantees: the resulting cascade meets a user-defined accuracy target (with respect to the oracle) up to a bounded failure probability. Across eight real-world document processing tasks at a 90% target accuracy, task cascades reduce end-to-end cost by an average of 36% compared to model cascades, at a production scale."}

Traditional SQL dialect translation tools rely on manually-crafted rules, necessitating significant manual effort to support new RDBMSs and dialects. Although large language models (LLMs) can assist in translating SQL dialects, they often struggle with lengthy and complex SQL queries.\n  In this paper, we propose RISE, a novel LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that can accurately handle lengthy and complex SQL queries. Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy. RISE achieves accuracies of 97.98% on TPC-DS and 100% on SQLProcBench, outperforming the baselines by an average improvement of 24.62% and 238.41%, respectively."}

We provide actionable guidance for researchers seeking to leverage this dataset in anomaly detection, protocol-misuse studies, threat intelligence, and defensive policy design.

To address such an explanation question about a ranking function, we investigate the computation of SHAP scores for column weights, adopting a recent framework by Grohe et al.[ICDT'24]. The exact definition of this score depends on three key components: (1) the ranking function in use, (2) an effect function that quantifies the impact of using alternative weights on the ranking, and (3) an underlying weight distribution. We analyze the computational complexity of different instantiations of this framework for a range of fundamental ranking and effect functions, focusing on probabilistically independent finite distributions for individual columns.\n  For the ranking functions, we examine lexicographic orders and score-based orders defined by the summation, minimum, and maximum functions. For the effect functions, we consider global, top-k, and local perspectives: global measures quantify the divergence between the perturbed and original rankings, top-k measures inspect the change in the set of top-k answers, and local measures capture the impact on an individual tuple of interest. Although all cases admit an additive fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), we establish the complexity of exact computation, identifying which cases are solvable in polynomial time and which are #P-hard. We further show that all complexity results, lower bounds and upper bounds, extend to a related task of computing the Shapley value of whole columns (regardless of their weight)."}

However, modern data stacks allow applications to generate data files (eg, Parquet) outside the DBMS’s purview that lack statistical summaries. Without information about data distribution, optimizers fall back to ungrounded guesses when computing cardinality and cost estimates needed to select the best plan from an exponential number of candidates. This thesis investigates the design of an adaptive query optimization strategy that leverages query feedback to improve planning for future queries. We first study how an optimizer should memoize query plans during optimization so that it can associate past traces with future queries. To facilitate this investigation, we built a Cascades-style transformational search engine with a memo table that organizes equivalent sub-plans and detects duplicates. We measured the amount of reuse when maintaining the optimization state across queries. Our results showed that future queries can reuse the cached optimization information from previous queries when they exhibit similar subplan patterns. We then analyze runtime feedback collection methods, focusing on integration strategies and the resulting artifacts. Our study reveals a tension between the query coverage provided by runtime artifacts and the collection overhead they entail. Although most DBMSs can provide runtime row-count profiles at the operator level, the optimizer can only use this information for future queries that match the exact predicates. To address this limitation, we present a method that measures the true selectivity of each prefix in the conjunctive predicate during execution, which the optimizer can then leverage to improve planning for a broader range of queries. We implemented this method in PostgreSQL and measured the runtime performance overhead. Our experiments show that fine-grained instrumentation incurs a constant overhead regardless of the number of conjuncts.

Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization.

Modern database management systems (DBMSs) are often operating on large volumes of data stored in object stores (like Amazon’s S3), open file formats (like Apache’s Parquet), or otherwise have outdated or nonexistent statistics. In join-heavy analytical workloads, the traditional approach of optimizing query plans to minimize the cost of joins breaks down if the available information to estimate cardinalities and costs is inaccurate. In recent years, a class of techniques known as “join pre-filtering” has gained focus as an attempt to reduce the reliance on a good optimizer for minimizing join costs by reducing the inputs of joins to the minimum set of tuples needed to produce the output. This thesis explores the current state-of-the-art in pre-filtering, and concludes that more work must be done to create a strategy that is applicable across a wide range of workloads. First, we provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of pre-filtering, and describe the key design decisions of and differences between currently studied techniques. We then evaluate two pre-filtering methods, min-max filters and Bloom filters, using a modified implementation of Dynamic Predicate Transfer (RPT+), a leading contemporary technique for join pre-filtering.

This approach offers minimal leverage for shaping design decisions with consideration for cost-effectiveness, thereby restricting its uses in the development of low-cost missile systems. To compensate for this gap, this paper presents MCDAT (Missile Cost Data-Driven Analysis Tool), a hybrid cost model platform created to incorporate economic factors into early stage implementation considerations. MCDAT decomposes the missile into critical subsystems such as solid rocket motor, inertial measurement unit or structures and exploits machine learning models, empirical parametric formulas and historical cost analysis for estimating unit production and life-cycle costs. Besides the first-unit production cost, the framework includes learning curve analysis, RDT&E, research and development estimation, and 30 years of maintenance forecasting cost using Monte Carlo simulation. Validation against French VT-1 surface-to-air missile cost showed 5.8% prediction errors and the subsystem allocation was consistent with tactical missile industry benchmarks. By design with cost being implemented as an active driver in the design loop versus a post-hoc constraint, MCDAT enables identifying and prioritizing affordable architectures at concept time, directing design space exploration, providing quantitative economic feedback when the engineering freedom of action is high.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2026-1120&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=12723657998052281529&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jRpY_220ykxGBUD-vnGgUlb&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2026-1120&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=12723657998052281529&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jRpY_220ykxGBUD-vnGgUlb&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | L Wattebled, A Jazzini, A Cox, D Mavris - AIAA SCITECH 2026 Forum, 2026 - arc.aiaa.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2026-1120", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Thorough exploration of the design space is important for minimizing cost while achieving performance objectives, as improvements in the early stage of design can have large downstream effects. This process relies heavily on the experience and intuition of engineers which limits the exploration of the design space. Given this, a method which will help teams of engineers explore the design space of spacecraft designs more thoroughly is desirable. For this problem both spacecraft component design and spacecraft configuration design are considered simultaneously instead of separately as they are typically treated both in the literature and in practice. To solve the problem, a transformer is trained using reinforcement learning. This model is then compared to a genetic algorithm and random search exploring the joint spacecraft component and configuration design space. Results indicate that while the reinforcement learning-trained transformer successfully learns to generate valid designs, it struggles to optimize on the objectives within the space of valid designs when compared to a genetic algorithm. This is in contrast to results found in the configuration-only problem, and further exploration into the capabilities and limitations of the method is necessary.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2026-0908&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=15266716691371453094&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jSWDDp20i6Z7CluZaAO3U_4&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2026-0908&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=15266716691371453094&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jSWDDp20i6Z7CluZaAO3U_4&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | A Demagall, D Selva - AIAA SCITECH 2026 Forum, 2026 - arc.aiaa.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2026-0908", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Federated Learning has emerged as a compelling paradigm for collaborative model training without centralizing data, yet integrating Federated Learning into multi-objective scheduling frameworks presents significant challenges. This paper proposes a comprehensive scheduling strategy that accounts for Federated Learning-specific requirements including model convergence time, communication overhead, and data heterogeneity while optimizing multiple conflicting objectives such as makespan, energy consumption, and resource utilization. We develop a hierarchical scheduling architecture that coordinates tasks between mobile edge computing servers, base stations, and cloud data centers while maintaining Federated Learning protocol integrity. The proposed approach employs an adaptive multi-objective optimization algorithm with dynamic crossover and mutation probabilities that adjusts resource allocation based on Federated Learning training progress and system state. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our Federated Learning-aware scheduling strategy with adaptive genetic algorithm parameters achieves superior performance compared to fixed-parameter approaches, reducing total system cost by approximately 28 percent while improving convergence speed by 35 percent. The framework effectively balances computation offloading decisions with Federated Learning communication patterns across the hierarchical mobile edge computing infrastructure, resulting in enhanced system efficiency for distributed edge-cloud environments.

Practically, such systems tend to reveal probabilistic results or confidence scores which are ill-calibrated and hard to read when under pressure. Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks. The present paper presents a decision-sensitive trust signal correspondence scheme of SOC alert triage. The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark. According to simulation findings, false negatives are greatly amplified by the presence of misaligned displays of confidence, whereas cost weighted loss decreases by orders of magnitude between models with decision aligned trust signals. Lastly, we describe a human-in-the-loop study plan that would allow empirically assessing the decision-making of the analysts with aligned and misaligned trust interfaces.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04486&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=11728347132915661446&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jTV6fHP3i0ephLcG_JNeEso&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04486&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=11728347132915661446&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jTV6fHP3i0ephLcG_JNeEso&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | IJ Chowdhury, MAY Tanvir - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.04486, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04486", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Traditional cache replacement policies such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) rely on simple heuristics that fail to capture complex temporal and frequency patterns in modern workloads. This research presents a modular machine learning-enhanced cache management framework that leverages pattern recognition to optimize database performance through intelligent replacement decisions. Our approach integrates multiple machine learning models—Random Forest classifiers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting methods—within a modular architecture enabling seamless integration with existing database systems. The framework incorporates sophisticated feature engineering pipelines extracting temporal, frequency, and contextual characteristics from query access patterns. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across synthetic workloads, real-world production datasets, and standard benchmarks (TPC-C, TPC-H, YCSB, and LinkBench) demonstrates consistent performance improvements. Machine learning-enhanced approaches achieve 8.4% to 19.2% improvement in cache hit rates, 15.3% to 28.7% reduction in query latency, and 18.9% to 31.4% increase in system throughput compared to traditional policies and advanced adaptive methods including ARC, LIRS, Clock-Pro, TinyLFU, and LECAR. Random Forest emerges as the most practical solution, providing 18.7% performance improvement with only 3.1% computational overhead.

However, modern data stacks allow applications to generate data files (eg, Parquet) outside the DBMS’s purview that lack statistical summaries. Without information about data distribution, optimizers fall back to ungrounded guesses when computing cardinality and cost estimates needed to select the best plan from an exponential number of candidates. This thesis investigates the design of an adaptive query optimization strategy that leverages query feedback to improve planning for future queries. We first study how an optimizer should memoize query plans during optimization so that it can associate past traces with future queries. To facilitate this investigation, we built a Cascades-style transformational search engine with a memo table that organizes equivalent sub-plans and detects duplicates. We measured the amount of reuse when maintaining the optimization state across queries. Our results showed that future queries can reuse the cached optimization information from previous queries when they exhibit similar subplan patterns. We then analyze runtime feedback collection methods, focusing on integration strategies and the resulting artifacts. Our study reveals a tension between the query coverage provided by runtime artifacts and the collection overhead they entail. Although most DBMSs can provide runtime row-count profiles at the operator level, the optimizer can only use this information for future queries that match the exact predicates. To address this limitation, we present a method that measures the true selectivity of each prefix in the conjunctive predicate during execution, which the optimizer can then leverage to improve planning for a broader range of queries. We implemented this method in PostgreSQL and measured the runtime performance overhead. Our experiments show that fine-grained instrumentation incurs a constant overhead regardless of the number of conjuncts. We conclude the thesis by discussing the design choices and trade-offs of integrating an extensible query optimizer service with existing DBMSs.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/anon/2025/CMU-CS-25-150.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=1054692481536127846&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jRD_qNeSQlxC0kHhQ3wwEbI&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/anon/2025/CMU-CS-25-150.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=1054692481536127846&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jRD_qNeSQlxC0kHhQ3wwEbI&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Y Liang - 2025 - reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/anon/home/ftp/usr/ftp/2025/CMU-CS-25-150.pdf", "scholar_enhanced": true}

A shallow U-Net is introduced to enhance the precision of local stress and strain fields computed using the Generalized Method of Cells (GMC) for fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites (PMCs). The network is trained on High-Fidelity Generalized Method of Cells (HFGMC) data so that the surrogate explicitly corrects GMC's lack of shear-normal coupling while improving the localization of the fields. Simultaneously, the innovative contracting/expansive architecture preserves the full spatial resolution of the underlying representative unit cell (RUC), unlike a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate. The optimization process encompasses both structural and hyperparameter fine-tuning, in which a broad set of design factors are varied and evaluated based on their influence on the learning and simulation steps. The resulting model achieves a low validation error (MSE ≈ 5.11 × 10⁵) and significantly refines localization. In particular, the measured linear regression coefficients (R² ≥ 0.965) underline the improvements in shear components, with slopes rising from 0.3604 to 0.9514 (stress) and from 0.6312 to 0.9640 (strain) relative to the ideal target (slope = 1.0, R² = 1.0).

Here we present a fully passive alternative: the Precision Health Integrated Diagnostic (PHIND) system, a smart-toilet-based platform that enables automated defecation monitoring without requiring users to alter their daily routines. By integrating optical and pressure sensors with cloud-based convolutional neural networks, the PHIND system classifies stool form according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale and records key defecatory parameters, including total event time, defecation duration and time to first stool drop. The protocol proceeds in three principal stages: (1) assembling and mounting the hardware onto a conventional toilet; (2) training convolutional neural network models for stool classification and event detection; and (3) image acquisition and deploying cloud infrastructure for real-time analysis, data storage and visualization. Compared with traditional methods that depend on user-reported stool diaries, PHIND provides objective, near real-time data free from recall error, enabling more reliable early detection and long-term management of gastrointestinal conditions. Researchers and clinicians can expect high classification accuracy and robust, longitudinal insights into defecation patterns. The complete protocol—from hardware setup to system validation—can typically be completed within 2 d, excluding printed circuit board manufacturing, which generally requires up to 15 d depending on the manufacturing provider.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-025-01296-9&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=12934547536064418714&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jTLGYHtdVRT9PUIclDyyt3s&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=9&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-025-01296-9&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=12934547536064418714&ei=WnFkabHlHrOlieoPyq27-AE&scisig=AHkA5jTLGYHtdVRT9PUIclDyyt3s&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=9&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Z Song, M Kim, J Lee, TH Kwon, J Kim, JH Kim… - Nature …, 2026 - nature.com", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-025-01296-9", "scholar_enhanced": true}

In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.", "categories": ["Google Scholar"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03523&hl=en&sa=X&d=4144234650923836821&ei=-KJkaZCGHoaw6rQPkNu46Ao&scisig=AHkA5jRSPSdispWOR9VfXIsJYOX2&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=2&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03523&hl=en&sa=X&d=4144234650923836821&ei=-KJkaZCGHoaw6rQPkNu46Ao&scisig=AHkA5jRSPSdispWOR9VfXIsJYOX2&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=2&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | K Nakamura, M Nishino, N Yasuda - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.03523, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03523", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Despite its widespread use, ROC-AUC can mask operationally salient differences among classifiers when the costs of false positives and false negatives are asymmetric. Using three benchmarks, credit-card fraud detection (0.17%), yeast protein localization (1.35%), and ozone level detection (2.9%), we compare ROC-AUC with Matthews Correlation Coefficient, F2-score, H-measure, and PR-AUC. Our empirical analyses span 20 classifier–sampler configurations per dataset, combined with four classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost) and four oversampling methods plus a no-resampling baseline (no resampling, SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE, ADASYN). ROC-AUC exhibits pronounced ceiling effects, yielding high scores even for underperforming models. In contrast, MCC and F2 align more closely with deployment-relevant costs and achieve the highest Kendall’s τ rank concordance across datasets; PR-AUC provides threshold-independent ranking, and H-measure integrates cost sensitivity. We quantify uncertainty and differences using stratified bootstrap confidence intervals, DeLong’s test for ROC-AUC, and Friedman–Nemenyi critical-difference diagrams, which collectively underscore the limited discriminative value of ROC-AUC in rare-event settings. The findings recommend a shift to a multi-metric evaluation framework: ROC-AUC should not be used as the primary metric in ultra-imbalanced settings; instead, MCC and F2 are recommended as primary indicators, supplemented by PR-AUC and H-measure where ranking granularity and principled cost integration are required.

A comprehensive tool is developed, combining long-term scenario generation using the TimeGAN deep learning model with multi-objective stochastic optimization of the energy system. To address TimeGAN’s limitations on long sequences, a dedicated preprocessing step based on frequency decomposition is introduced, enabling the capture of multi-scale patterns in climatic and consumption data. The generated synthetic scenarios are rigorously validated using statistical and spectral criteria, and are then used as inputs for the sizing phase. The methodology is applied to a real case study on La Réunion Island, demonstrating its effectiveness for designing autonomous, low-carbon, and uncertainty-resilient energy systems.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://theses.hal.science/tel-05450784/file/EBNOU.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13400850301655297292&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jTGW6DaqZEaEEkeV6Xkf7PH&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://theses.hal.science/tel-05450784/file/EBNOU.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13400850301655297292&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jTGW6DaqZEaEEkeV6Xkf7PH&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | H Ebnou - 2025 - theses.hal.science", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://theses.hal.science/tel-05450784/", "scholar_enhanced": true}
{"id": "scholar_0634ccc335c3749faa970c3bbfa56b65", "title": "The Impact of Distributed Data Query Optimization on Large-Scale Data Processing", "authors": ["J Li"], "summary": "With the rapid advancement of big data technology, distributed architecture has become the mainstream in the industry when processing massive amounts of information. However, when dealing with such large datasets, the query efficiency and performance of the system become key factors that constrain its response speed and accuracy. This study analyzed the key performance bottlenecks of distributed data queries, such as storage response latency, hardware processing capacity limits, and data consistency assurance. Based on this, a series of targeted improvement measures were proposed. Specifically, in terms of distributed storage network latency, hardware resource upgrade requirements, and data consistency maintenance, research has proposed solutions such as optimizing data distribution, regularly upgrading hardware facilities, and adopting distributed locking strategies. After implementing these optimization measures, query response can be accelerated, data accuracy can be ensured, and hardware costs and maintenance expenses can be reduced. The research results show that these optimization methods can enhance the overall performance of processing large-scale data systems.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://scholar-press.com/uploads/papers/MqdQVq1D1qRjjKwMLwfUca9PGUaGXxdTmWlltc1C.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=17354762022946573543&ei=hKtlaaWUIbux6rQP76-2-Qc&scisig=AHkA5jTdYYxy8ewfQL1lqWCldK0J&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://scholar-press.com/uploads/papers/MqdQVq1D1qRjjKwMLwfUca9PGUaGXxdTmWlltc1C.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=17354762022946573543&ei=hKtlaaWUIbux6rQP76-2-Qc&scisig=AHkA5jTdYYxy8ewfQL1lqWCldK0J&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | J Li - 2025 - scholar-press.com", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "http://scholar-press.com/uploads/papers/MqdQVq1D1qRjjKwMLwfUca9PGUaGXxdTmWlltc1C.pdf", "scholar_enhanced": true}
