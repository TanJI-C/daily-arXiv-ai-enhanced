The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.\n  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's \"relational color refinement\" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.\n  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5e93 $D_{col}$\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e $D_{col}$ \u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u81ea\u7531\u8fde\u63a5\u65e0\u73af\u5408\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\uff08fc-ACQ\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e38\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\u679a\u4e3e\u6216\u8ba1\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u7d22\u5f15\u5229\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u7740\u8272\u7cbe\u5316\uff08relational color refinement\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5176\u5927\u5c0f\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982B+\u6811\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u503c\u6216\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5143\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347fc-ACQ\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eScheidt\u548cSchweikardt\uff082025\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u201c\u5173\u7cfb\u7740\u8272\u7cbe\u5316\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5e93 $D_{col}$\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5143\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u7740\u8272\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c$D_{col}$ \u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u4e8e\u7740\u8272\u540e\u7684\u989c\u8272\u6570\u3002\u5229\u7528 $D_{col}$ \u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u5904\u7406\u540e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u4efb\u610ffc-ACQ\u8fdb\u884c\u5e38\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\u679a\u4e3e\u6216\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610ffc-ACQ\uff0c\u53ef\u5728 $O(|D_{col}|)$ \u9884\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e38\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\u679a\u4e3e\u6216\u7b54\u6848\u8ba1\u6570\u3002$D_{col}$ \u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u81f3\u591a\u4e3a $|D|$\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c0f\uff08\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u751a\u81f3\u5e38\u6570\u7ea7\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u89c4\u6a21\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u7740\u8272\u7cbe\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u8f85\u52a9\u7ed3\u6784 $D_{col}$\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9fc-ACQ\u7c7b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7ebf\u6027\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7d22\u5f15\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.\n  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.\n  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.", "AI": {"tldr": "LGTD is a season-length-free time series decomposition method that models seasonal patterns as emergent from adaptive local trends, eliminating the need for predefined or estimated season lengths and improving robustness in heterogeneous and irregular time series.", "motivation": "Existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods often require user-specified or estimated season lengths and assume stable periodicity, which limits their robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with drifting, intermittent, or multi-scale seasonal patterns.", "method": "LGTD decomposes a time series into a smooth global trend, adaptive local linear trends (via an error-driven module called AutoTrend) that implicitly induce seasonal structure, and a residual component\u2014without requiring any explicit season length input.", "result": "Experiments on synthetic data show LGTD achieves robust and balanced decomposition performance across various seasonal settings (fixed, transitive, variable), outperforming period-based methods especially when seasonality is irregular or drifting; the method also scales linearly with time series length.", "conclusion": "LGTD provides a more flexible, automated, and scalable approach to time series decomposition by treating seasonality as emergent rather than predefined, enhancing deployability in large and heterogeneous time series collections."}}

In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity.
