Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH₂) systems provide a viable solution by converting surplus renewable into hydrogen, which can be stored and used across different sectors. This review focuses on focuses on modelling strategies applied to three core PtH₂ processes: hydrogen production via electrolysis, storage, and integration into smart grids. Traditional modelling approaches including computational fluid dynamics (CFD), techno-economic analysis (TEA), process simulation, and linear programming (LP) remain essential for system design but are limited in handling dynamic, real-time operations. In contrast, emerging methods including machine learning (ML), reinforcement learning (RL), surrogate modelling, digital twins, and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) platforms offer improved adaptability, predictive control, and operator interaction. However, these tools face limitations related to data availability, computational cost, model interpretability, and integration with existing simulation environments. The review identifies a growing shift toward hybrid modelling frameworks that combine physical accuracy with data-driven adaptability. Future research should focus on building standardised datasets, developing interoperable modelling platforms, expanding the role of real-time visualisation technologies, and must be supported not only by technical innovation but also by evolving policy for scalable and resilient PtH₂-integrated smart grid.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/SJIE/article/download/21844/18098&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13139259894094912961&ei=6pFuadGBDbK16rQP872hoQc&scisig=AHkA5jSOyTEaSLZpCMeYr99C1euk&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/SJIE/article/download/21844/18098&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13139259894094912961&ei=6pFuadGBDbK16rQP872hoQc&scisig=AHkA5jSOyTEaSLZpCMeYr99C1euk&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | CD Valencia, A Xu… - The Sydney …, 2025 - openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/SJIE/article/view/21844", "scholar_enhanced": true}

In contrast to the optimizations explored in these systems, we observe that different matrix re-associations of GNN computations lead to novel input-sensitive performance behavior. We leverage this observation to propose GRANII, a system that exposes different compositions of sparse and dense matrix primitives based on different matrix re-associations of GNN computations and selects the best among them based on input attributes. GRANII executes in two stages:(1) an offline compilation stage that enumerates all valid re-associations leading to different sparse-dense matrix compositions and uses inputoblivious pruning techniques to prune away clearly unprofitable candidates, and (2) an online runtime system that explores the remaining candidates and uses light-weight cost models to select the best re-association based on the input graph and the embedding sizes. On a wide range of configurations, GRANII achieves a geo-mean speedup of 1.56× for inference and 1.4× for training across multiple GNN models and systems.

However, achieving efficient collaborative decision-making in such architectures poses critical challenges within dynamic and complex computing network environments, including dynamic resource allocation, incentive alignment between cloud and edge entities, and multi-objective optimization. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic resource optimization framework for complex cloud–edge collaborative networks, decomposing the problem into two hierarchical decision schemes: cloud-level coordination and edge-side coordination, thereby achieving adaptive resource orchestration across the End–edge–cloud continuum. Furthermore, leveraging differential game theory, we model the dynamic resource allocation and cooperation incentives between cloud and edge nodes, and derive a feedback Nash equilibrium to maximize the overall system utility, effectively resolving the inherent conflicts of interest in cloud–edge collaboration. Additionally, we formulate a joint optimization model for energy consumption and latency, and propose an Improved Discrete Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (IDAHA) to achieve an optimal trade-off between these competing objectives, addressing the challenge of multi-objective coordination from the user perspective. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods exhibit superior performance in multi-objective optimization, incentive alignment, and dynamic resource decision-making, significantly enhancing the adaptability and collaborative efficiency of complex cloud–edge networks.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/14/2/320&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=3354501938088321530&ei=6pFuadGBDbK16rQP872hoQc&scisig=AHkA5jTA4wl9M8rXuoEiXa4DwsgB&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=4&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/14/2/320&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=3354501938088321530&ei=6pFuadGBDbK16rQP872hoQc&scisig=AHkA5jTA4wl9M8rXuoEiXa4DwsgB&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=4&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | C Qi, Z Zhang - Mathematics, 2026 - mdpi.com", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/14/2/320", "scholar_enhanced": true}
