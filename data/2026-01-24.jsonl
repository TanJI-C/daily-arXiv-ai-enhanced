Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language. NL4ST features a three-layer architecture: (i) knowledge base and corpus for knowledge preparation, (ii) natural language understanding for entity linking, and (iii) generating physical plans. Our demonstration will showcase how NL4ST provides effective spatio-temporal physical plans, verified by using four real and synthetic datasets. We make NL4ST online and provide the demo video at https://youtu.be/-J1R7R5WoqQ."}

Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.

While static algorithms are inefficient due to full re-execution, incremental algorithms suffer from severe performance and memory bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EAIFD, a novel algorithm for incremental FD discovery. EAIFD maintains the partial hypergraph of difference sets and reframes the incremental FD discovery problem into minimal hitting set enumeration on hypergraph, avoiding full re-runs. EAIFD introduces two key innovations. First, a multi-attribute hash table ($MHT$) is devised for high-frequency key-value mappings of valid FDs, whose memory consumption is proven to be independent of the dataset size. Second, two-step validation strategy is developed to efficiently validate the enumerated candidates, which leverages $MHT$ to effectively reduce the validation space and then selectively loads data blocks for batch validation of remaining candidates, effectively avoiding repeated I/O operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of EAIFD. Compared to existing algorithms, EAIFD achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in runtime while reducing memory usage by over two orders-of-magnitude, establishing it as a highly efficient and scalable solution for incremental FD discovery."}

Luo et al.", "authors": ["F Luo", "H Lan", "H Luo", "Z Bao", "JS Culpepper", "S Sadiq…"], "summary": "Missing values in tabular data lakes can severely impact data analysis and diminish the performance in downstream applications. We highlight that a robust imputation strategy should properly take three aspects of variety into consideration: source of imputed value, the types of tables involved, and the data types of the missing value. Existing imputation methods rely on estimation-based approaches (using a model trained on data from the same table to estimate missing values) or search-based approaches (retrieving values from other tables). Unfortunately, none of these approaches effectively incorporate all three aspects of variety. To address this gap, we propose CESID, a novel framework that uses a Combination of Estimation-based and Search-based methods for missing value Imputation in Data lakes. CESID contains three core modules: (1) the Contextual Search Module, which efficiently discovers candidate values from tables by exploiting the contextual information; (2) the Acquisition-guided Estimation Module, which introduces an influence function and a sampling-based exploration strategy to yield accurate estimated values; (3) the Classifier Module, which determines the most suitable method based on table-level and column-level statistics.

To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding confidence and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a confidence-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. This design enables effective bidirectional information flow within the decoding window without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.39% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 9.0%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02076&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=1915482236404124982&ei=H3ByaebiO_OlieoPkILrwAk&scisig=AHkA5jSIfa7a_J_3aEFHUin_0Jpv&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02076&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=1915482236404124982&ei=H3ByaebiO_OlieoPkILrwAk&scisig=AHkA5jSIfa7a_J_3aEFHUin_0Jpv&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Y Shu, Y Tian, C Xu, Y Wang, H Chen - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.02076, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02076", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Phase 1 tested the cost scale’s reliability and validity through exploratory ( n = 260) and confirmatory factor analyses ( n = 289). In Phase 2, five hypothesized models integrating cost, expectancy, and value were compared ( n = 464), and multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate predictive validity. Results Factor analyses supported a second-order four-factor structure—physical and physiological, psychological, opportunity, and social costs. Model comparisons showed that treating cost as an independent, multidimensional, and hierarchical construct provided the most robust structure.

Grounded in an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) framework, this study employed a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design to investigate the factors influencing digital technology adoption among K–12 PE teachers in China. The study first quantitatively surveyed 503 practitioners, followed by qualitative semistructured interviews with 15 teachers to provide deeper contextual insights. Quantitative results revealed that behavioral intention was most strongly and positively influenced by information quality (β = 0.333) and social influence (β = 0.299), with performance expectancy and effort expectancy also being significant. Perceived cost was found to be insignificant, while habit had a minimal impact. Use behavior was primarily driven by facilitating conditions (β = 0.288) and behavioral intention (β = 0.250). Gender, age, school type, and voluntariness significantly moderated these relationships. Qualitative findings contextualized these statistical results, providing in-depth explanations for the hierarchical importance of the predictors and the underlying reasons for the nonsignificant and weaker paths within the PE teaching environment.
