Unfortunately, traditional approaches such as fair sharing do not provide performance isolation for storage systems, because their resources (e.g., write buffers and read caches) exhibit high preemption delays. These delays lead to unacceptable spikes in client tail latencies, as clients may be forced to wait arbitrarily long to receive their fair share of resources.\n  We introduce Delta Fair Sharing, a family of algorithms for sharing resources with high preemption delays. These algorithms satisfy two key properties: $\u03b4$-fairness, which bounds a client's delay in receiving its fair share of resources to $\u03b4$ time units, and $\u03b4$-Pareto-efficiency, which allocates unused resources to clients with unmet demand. Together, these properties capture resource-acquisition delays end-to-end, bound well-behaved clients' tail-latency spikes to $\u03b4$ time units, and ensure high utilization. We implement such algorithms in FAIRDB, an extension of RocksDB. Our evaluation shows that FAIRDB isolates well-behaved clients from high-demand workloads better than state-of-the-art alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDelta Fair Sharing\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u03b4-\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u03b4-\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u62a2\u5360\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728RocksDB\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86FAIRDB\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e3a\u591a\u79df\u6237\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u5199\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u548c\u8bfb\u7f13\u5b58\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u62a2\u5360\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDelta Fair Sharing\u7b97\u6cd5\u65cf\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u03b4-\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u03b4\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u83b7\u5f97\u5176\u5e94\u5f97\u8d44\u6e90\u4efd\u989d\uff09\u548c\u03b4-\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6548\u7387\uff08\u5c06\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6709\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728RocksDB\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aFAIRDB\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cFAIRDB\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u884c\u4e3a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9694\u79bb\u5f00\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c16\u5cf0\u3002", "conclusion": "Delta Fair Sharing\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a7\u5236\u8d44\u6e90\u83b7\u53d6\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u6027\u80fd\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u79df\u6237\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Column names and descriptions are valuable for this task. LLMs can leverage such natural-language schema metadata. However, in many datasets, correct matching requires additional evidence beyond the column itself. Because it is impractical to provide an LLM with the entire schema metadata needed to capture this evidence, the core challenge becomes to select and organize the most useful contextual information.\n  We present ConStruM, a structure-guided framework for budgeted evidence packing in schema matching. ConStruM constructs a lightweight, reusable structure in which, at query time, it assembles a small context pack emphasizing the most discriminative evidence. ConStruM is designed as an add-on: given a shortlist of candidate targets produced by an upstream matcher, it augments the matcher's final LLM prompt with structured, query-specific evidence so that the final selection is better grounded. For this purpose, we develop a context tree for budgeted multi-level context retrieval and a global similarity hypergraph that surfaces groups of highly similar columns (on both the source and target sides), summarized via group-aware differentiation cues computed online or precomputed offline. Experiments on real datasets show that ConStruM improves matching by providing and organizing the right contextual evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConStruM is a structure-guided framework that improves schema column matching by selectively packing the most discriminative contextual evidence into LLM prompts under budget constraints.", "motivation": "Existing LLM-based schema matching methods often lack sufficient contextual evidence beyond column names and descriptions, yet providing full schema metadata is impractical; thus, there is a need for an efficient method to select and organize the most useful contextual information for accurate matching.", "method": "ConStruM constructs a lightweight, reusable structure comprising a context tree for multi-level budgeted retrieval and a global similarity hypergraph that identifies groups of highly similar columns.

In this paper, we propose ALER, a novel, semi-supervised pipeline designed to bridge the gap between semantic accuracy and computational scalability. ALER eliminates the training bottleneck by using a frozen bi-encoder architecture to generate static embeddings once and then iteratively training a lightweight classifier on top. To address the memory bottleneck associated with large-scale candidate pools, we first select a representative sample of the data and then use K-Means to partition this sample into semantically coherent chunks, enabling an efficient AL loop.

However, constrained edge devices often cannot serve the increasingly large and complex deep learning (DL) models. To mitigate these challenges, researchers have proposed optimizing and offloading partitions of DL models among user devices, edge servers, and the cloud. In this setting, users can take advantage of different services to support their intelligent applications. For example, edge resources offer low response latency. In contrast, cloud platforms provide low monetary cost computation resources for computation-intensive workloads. However, communication between DL model partitions can introduce transmission bottlenecks and pose risks of data leakage. Recent research aims to balance accuracy, computation delay, transmission delay, and privacy concerns. They address these issues with model compression, model distillation, transmission compression, and model architecture adaptations, including internal classifiers. This survey contextualizes the state-of-the-art model offloading methods and model adaptation techniques by studying their implication to a multi-objective optimization comprising inference latency, data privacy, and resource monetary cost.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt23j1s4bg/qt23j1s4bg.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4230595382320065700&ei=fot6aa3GOJ2J6rQP586poAg&scisig=AHkA5jQ_u7oimfQ3Ui_sjDYNJJMG&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt23j1s4bg/qt23j1s4bg.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4230595382320065700&ei=fot6aa3GOJ2J6rQP586poAg&scisig=AHkA5jQ_u7oimfQ3Ui_sjDYNJJMG&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Z Zhang, I Matta - Journal of Systems Research, 2025 - escholarship.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://escholarship.org/uc/item/23j1s4bg", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5378\u8f7d\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740VR/AR\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u96be\u4ee5\u627f\u8f7d\u65e5\u76ca\u5e9e\u5927\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u4e91\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5212\u5206\u4e0e\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u538b\u7f29\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7f6e\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}
{"id": "scholar_30cadf899bd971bec08a6e87146c7bf0", "title": "A Continuous Optimization Approach for Deadline-Constrained Cloud Workflow Scheduling", "authors": ["L Yang", "L Ye", "Y Xia"], "summary": "In cloud computing, deadline-constrained workflow scheduling, a typical NP-hard problem, plays a vital role in meeting users\u2019 quality-of-service (QoS) and efficiently managing cloud resources. Its core difficulty lies in handling the deadline constraint, where existing methods suffer from two major issues: fixed deadline distribution strategies, which lack adaptability to diverse workflows, and inefficient metaheuristic search, which requires discrete encodings and repair rules in the combinatorial space. To overcome these limitations, we propose a continuous optimization approach to efficiently address the deadline constraint. The basic idea is to find the suitable sub-deadline of each task by iterative optimization for each workflow. First, treating each task\u2019s sub-deadline as a decision variable, a continuous optimization problem is established to solve deadline-constrained workflow scheduling. Then, a Dynamic Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization with Social Learning (SL-DMSPSO) algorithm is proposed for this continuous optimization problem, incorporating with the following two novel designs: 1) the entire population is divided into multiple swarms and is re-divided at each iteration, ensuring that swarms are dynamic and randomly assigned, which facilitates information exchange among swarms and enhances exploration diversity. 2) social learning is introduced when updating the particles in each swarm, combined with individual learning to balance diversity and convergence. Experiments are conducted on real-world workflows to compare SL-DMSPSO with state-of-the-art algorithms and the results reveal the superiority of SL-DMSPSO in effectively scheduling deadline-constrained workflows in clouds.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11363206/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=11188301759727069938&ei=fot6aa3GOJ2J6rQP586poAg&scisig=AHkA5jSBJqi0T02CBP5b5F3ZA9_W&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=2&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11363206/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=11188301759727069938&ei=fot6aa3GOJ2J6rQP586poAg&scisig=AHkA5jSBJqi0T02CBP5b5F3ZA9_W&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=2&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | L Yang, L Ye, Y Xia - IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2026 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11363206/", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5SL-DMSPSO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u7fa4\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5b50\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u4e3a\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8f6c\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b50\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1Dynamic Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization with Social Learning (SL-DMSPSO)\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u968f\u673a\u91cd\u7ec4\u591a\u4e2a\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SL-DMSPSO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8c03\u5ea6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6ee1\u8db3\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u7fa4\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684PSO\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2dQoS\u4fdd\u969c\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In these environments, ETL pipelines must process large, distributed datasets while minimizing latency and transfer cost. Push down optimization, which executes transformation logic within database engines rather than within the ETL tool, has proven highly effective in single cloud systems. However, when applied across multiple clouds, it faces challenges related to data movement, heterogeneous SQL engines, orchestration complexity, and fragmented security controls. This paper examines the feasibility of push down optimization in multi cloud ETL pipelines and analyzes its benefits and limitations. It evaluates localized push down, hybrid models, and data federation techniques that reduce cross cloud traffic while improving performance. A case study across Redshift and BigQuery demonstrates measurable gains, including lower end to end runtime, reduced transfer volume, and improved cost efficiency. The study highlights practical strategies that organizations can adopt to improve ETL scalability and reliability in distributed cloud environments.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinoth-Punniyamoorthy/publication/400035834_Push_Down_Optimization_for_Distributed_Multi_Cloud_Data_Integration/links/6973fbf558b9985baa8a8ad0/Push-Down-Optimization-for-Distributed-Multi-Cloud-Data-Integration.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=9015851721569140497&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jQz7Y7HLlQg_wEWIxkFL5SJ&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinoth-Punniyamoorthy/publication/400035834_Push_Down_Optimization_for_Distributed_Multi_Cloud_Data_Integration/links/6973fbf558b9985baa8a8ad0/Push-Down-Optimization-for-Distributed-Multi-Cloud-Data-Integration.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=9015851721569140497&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jQz7Y7HLlQg_wEWIxkFL5SJ&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | RK Kodali, V Punniyamoorthy, AK Agarwal\u2026 - International Journal of \u2026 - researchgate.net", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinoth-Punniyamoorthy/publication/400035834_Push_Down_Optimization_for_Distributed_Multi_Cloud_Data_Integration/links/6973fbf558b9985baa8a8ad0/Push-Down-Optimization-for-Distributed-Multi-Cloud-Data-Integration.pdf", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u4e91ETL\uff08\u62bd\u53d6\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u52a0\u8f7d\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e0b\u63a8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u5316\u4e0b\u63a8\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8054\u90a6\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Redshift\u4e0eBigQuery\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u53ca\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u591a\u4e91\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34ETL\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u4e0b\u63a8\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5355\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u5f02\u6784SQL\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u7f16\u6392\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0b\u63a8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u672c\u5730\u5316\u4e0b\u63a8\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8054\u90a6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Amazon Redshift\u4e0eGoogle BigQuery\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aefETL\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0b\u63a8\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u591a\u4e91ETL\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u591a\u4e91ETL\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u4e0b\u63a8\u4f18\u5316\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6267\u884c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8054\u90a6\u7b49\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3aETL\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}
{"id": "scholar_8e7f3209eb02ddb44211440cb6fde48a", "title": "A new relational division operation and its implementation", "authors": ["D Tlekbay"], "summary": "Universal quantification\u2014that is, requirements which must be met by all related entities\u2014is a foundational yet challenging concept for SQL to capture efficiently. Whereas such conditions are natural in logical formalisms (such as relational calculus), SQL offers no direct \u201cFOR ALL\u201d quantifier nor a relational division operator. Thus, universal queries are typically expressed through nested negation, set difference, or aggregation, which can obscure intent and lead to varying performance across database systems. This thesis uses relational division as the algebraic foundation for representing universal quantification and looks into how the classical and extended forms can be implemented effectively in SQL. This study contrasts several relational division operators, such as standard division, generalized division, the small and great divide, and the grouped generalized division. A comparative framework is developed for these operators in respect of semantics, expressiveness, realizability, rewriteability, and computational complexity. These results indicate that the grouped generalized division operator is the most expressive and SQL-compatible manner of expressing restricted and grouped universal queries. This naturally matches up with newer features in SQL such as grouping and aggregation. It enables efficient evaluation strategies supported by contemporary query optimizers. This results in the finding that relational division remains a central concept in bridging logical expressiveness and practical query optimization in the relational model.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstreams/17119f3d-f634-4612-b7ef-eec95b859ba7/download&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=6583700010539202906&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jS3E50Hu9xUkfxmD6tgSyWU&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstreams/17119f3d-f634-4612-b7ef-eec95b859ba7/download&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=6583700010539202906&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jS3E50Hu9xUkfxmD6tgSyWU&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | D Tlekbay - 2025 - aaltodoc.aalto.fi", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/items/cedd5838-d4a3-4d8f-b374-85391be23726", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728SQL\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8868\u8fbe\u5168\u79f0\u91cf\u5316\uff08universal quantification\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5173\u7cfb\u9664\u6cd5\uff08relational division\uff09\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u7ec4\u5e7f\u4e49\u9664\u6cd5\uff08grouped generalized division\uff09\u662f\u6700\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e14\u4e0eSQL\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "SQL\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8868\u8fbe\u201c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u201d\uff08FOR ALL\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5d4c\u5957\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u96c6\u5408\u5dee\u6216\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u79f0\u91cf\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u5173\u7cfb\u9664\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ee3\u6570\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u9664\u6cd5\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u9664\u6cd5\u3001\u5e7f\u4e49\u9664\u6cd5\u3001\u5c0f\u9664/\u5927\u9664\u3001\u5206\u7ec4\u5e7f\u4e49\u9664\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u5199\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7ec4\u5e7f\u4e49\u9664\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u5168\u79f0\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e0eSQL\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7279\u6027\u81ea\u7136\u5951\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u88ab\u73b0\u4ee3\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5173\u7cfb\u9664\u6cd5\u4ecd\u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Traditional inventory systems often face limitations in handling unstructured data and providing timely decision support. To address these challenges, a modular framework incorporating NLP, machine learning, and a hybrid database architecture is proposed and evaluated. The system enables users to interact through natural language queries, which are translated into improved SQL commands using semantic parsing and Transformer models. Performance evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates significant improvements in query execution time, demand prediction accuracy, and inventory optimization. Comparative results indicate that the NLP-based system outperforms conventional systems in both cost-efficiency and responsiveness.

SQL is highly optimized for processing structured data laid out in relations. Meanwhile, in the present application development landscape, it is highly desirable to utilize the power of learned models to perform complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to understand and extract information from unstructured textual data. However, SQL as a query language and accompanying relational database systems are either incompatible or inefficient for workloads that require leveraging learned models. This results in complex engineering and multiple data migration operations that move data between the data sources and the model inference platform. In this paper, we present iPDB, a relational system that supports in-database machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) inferencing using extended SQL syntax. In iPDB, LLMs and ML calls can function as semantic projects, as predicates to perform semantic selects and semantic joins, or for semantic grouping in group-by clauses. iPDB has a novel relational predict operator and semantic query optimizations that enable users to write and efficiently execute semantic SQL queries, outperforming the state-of-the-art.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16432&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8841939764722241224&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jSt-8-f5X0PXqDpCgUknlg4&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16432&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8841939764722241224&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jSt-8-f5X0PXqDpCgUknlg4&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | U Kumarasinghe, T Liu, C Liu, WG Aref - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.16432, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16432", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86iPDB\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55SQL\u8bed\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5206\u7ec4\u7b49\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSQL\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u652f\u6301\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faiPDB\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6269\u5c55SQL\u8bed\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165LLM\u548cML\u8c03\u7528\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u5b50\uff08relational predict operator\uff09\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u4e49\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u5206\u7ec4\uff09\u53ef\u88ab\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "iPDB\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LLM\u548cML\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\uff0ciPDB\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0eAI\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
