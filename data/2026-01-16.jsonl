STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs."}

Many resources are created using vocabularies that are FAIR-compliant and well-annotated, yet the collective ecosystem of these resources often fails to interoperate effectively in practice. This continued challenge is mainly due to variation in identifier schemas and data models used in these resources. We have created two tools to bridge the chasm between interoperability in principle and interoperation in practice. Babel solves the problem of multiple identifier schemes by producing a curated set of identifier mappings to create cliques of equivalent identifiers that are exposed through high-performance APIs. ORION solves the problems of multiple data models by ingesting knowledge bases and transforming them into a common, community-managed data model. Here, we describe Babel and ORION and demonstrate their ability to support data interoperation. A library of fully interoperable knowledge bases created through the application of Babel and ORION is available for download and use at https://robokop.renci.org."}

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods."}

Following this idea, we present the design of TransactionMerger, a middleware to collect and merge transactions across different clients. We further present a static analysis tool to identify the merging opportunity without violating isolation as well as our experience of re-writing transactions in TPC-C and Spree, a popular real-world application. Our evaluation shows that such transaction merging can improve TPC-C throughput by up to 2.65X and Spree throughput by 3.52X."}

This paper introduces Vextra, a novel middleware abstraction layer designed to address this fragmentation. Vextra presents a unified, high-level API for core database operations, including data upsertion, similarity search, and metadata filtering. It employs a pluggable adapter architecture to translate these unified API calls into the native protocols of various backend databases.

Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery.

This study introduces a metaheuristic framework for optimized dimensionality reduction to identify the highly discriminative feature subsets. The proposed method (KDRPSO) combines a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with the K-Nearest Neighbors Distance Ratio (KDR) as a filterbased objective function. This metric quantitatively assesses class separability within a feature subspace by computing the ratio of the average distance from a sample to neighbors in other classes versus those in its own class. Maximizing this ratio with a penalty for model size, KDR-PSO automates the discovery of parsimonious feature sets that maximize inter-class discrimination. The method is computationally efficient, naturally lending itself to multi-class classification and avoiding the prohibitive cost associated with classifier-in-the-loop wrappers. Experimental results on benchmark gene expression and image datasets show that KDR-PSO can achieve better dimensionality reduction compared to baselines and other algorithms, such as winning a better or at least similar performing models with decreased features.

DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous \"ragged filtration\" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) - a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices.

By Filtering invalid resource nodes via multidimensional constraints to reduce computational load, and prioritizes user requests using a weighted scoring model. Validated on a real-world cloud platform, our method achieves remarkable performance improvements across different load scenarios. Compared with the optimal baseline, it attains a comprehensive score enhancement of 2.56%, 3.44%, and 16.8% under idle, normal, and stress states, respectively. Meanwhile, it achieves a reduction of 0.25%, 0.35%, and 0.45% in the server overload percentage corresponding to the aforementioned scenarios.

Focusing on Optimal Transport (OT), we introduce a novel notion of group fairness requiring that the probability of matching two individuals from any two given groups in the OT plan satisfies a predefined target. We first propose \\texttt{FairSinkhorn}, a modified Sinkhorn algorithm to compute perfectly fair transport plans efficiently. Since exact fairness can significantly degrade matching quality in practice, we then develop two relaxation strategies. The first one involves solving a penalised OT problem, for which we derive novel finite-sample complexity guarantees. This result is of independent interest as it can be generalized to arbitrary convex penalties. Our second strategy leverages bilevel optimization to learn a ground cost that induces a fair OT solution, and we establish a bound guaranteeing that the learned cost yields fair matchings on unseen data.

To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07830&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=12307612327796868984&ei=57xoaY2BOr6Z6rQPnvC-6QQ&scisig=AHkA5jQkAiefuNmn9aji0AsW9nUC&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=4&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07830&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=12307612327796868984&ei=57xoaY2BOr6Z6rQPnvC-6QQ&scisig=AHkA5jQkAiefuNmn9aji0AsW9nUC&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=4&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | V Njaradi, R Carrasco-Davis, PE Latham… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07830", "scholar_enhanced": true}

This paper develops a consolidated mathematical framework that unifies algorithmic optimization methods with system-level constraints to improve computational efficiency in such environments. The framework integrates convex optimization, stochastic gradient methods, distributed primal–dual updates, and adaptive scheduling models, allowing each component of a data system memory, I/O, communication bandwidth, task queues, and compute throughput to be expressed as an optimization surface. By formalizing computation cost as a multivariate function of latency, bandwidth contention, node failures, and parallelization overhead, the framework enables analytical comparisons of algorithmic strategies under real system conditions. The study synthesizes existing optimization models and proposes a hybrid large-scale solver that combines coordinate descent, variance-reduced gradients, and asynchronous update rules to stabilize convergence even when data is partitioned unevenly or updates are delayed. The resulting formulation reduces communication rounds, improves throughput, and demonstrates strong resilience to straggler effects.

However, IoT data are vulnerable to malicious alterations, potentially leading to energy theft from unbilled consumption. Such thefts can cause billions in annual financial revenue losses. Traditional Machine learning (ML) techniques offer promising solutions for Energy Theft Detection (ETD), yet they struggle with data imbalance and privacy concerns. The data imbalance stems from the dominant representation of honest users and the poor representation of the rare theft cases. Leading ML-based ETD methods employ synthetic data generation to balance the training dataset. However, these methods are trained to maximise average detection instead of ETD, not showing a true reflection of theft detection. To address these issues, we introduce an energy-aware evaluation framework, a convolutional neural network with positive bias (CNN-B) and another with CNN focal loss (CNN-FL), to address the data imbalance by focusing on maximising ETD while minimising revenue loss. As a result, we achieve a revenue loss reduction of 30.4%. Furthermore, this thesis propose a privacy-aware federated learning (FL) based CNN model (FLCNN) that incorporates differential privacy. This model safeguards consumer data during ETD and outperforms traditional centralised methods in terms of bandwidth requirement and reducing false theft attributions. The theft detection of FL-CNN has improved significantly, reducing revenue loss by 41%. Together, these innovations represent a comprehensive approach to enhancing ETD while safeguarding consumer privacy and reducing financial losses in smart grid environments.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/116073/ZunairaNadeem_PhDThesis.pdf%3Fsequence%3D2&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4247858908552099790&ei=57xoaY2BOr6Z6rQPnvC-6QQ&scisig=AHkA5jTjGFAPcfkFeklCavbggmdg&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=6&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/116073/ZunairaNadeem_PhDThesis.pdf%3Fsequence%3D2&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4247858908552099790&ei=57xoaY2BOr6Z6rQPnvC-6QQ&scisig=AHkA5jTjGFAPcfkFeklCavbggmdg&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=6&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Z Nadeem - 2026 - qmro.qmul.ac.uk", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/116073", "scholar_enhanced": true}

This allows for zero-shot onboarding of new models without full-scale retraining.

Project STARSCREAM explores a complementary lever: pretraining and auxiliary self-supervision on large-scale, naturally occurring, non-anthropogenic observational streams from astronomy and astrophysics (for example, sky-survey imagery, time-domain light curves, spectroscopy, and event catalogs). This paper proposes a scientific program to test whether cosmic observational data can measurably improve robustness and adaptability of modern architectures (transformers, state-space and linear-attention sequence models, convolutional backbones, and multimodal encoders). We frame STARSCREAM as a methods hypothesis rather than a claim: that exposure to high-entropy, instrument-mediated signals and naturally structured noise can regularize representation learning, improve calibration, and increase out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on downstream tasks that involve temporal dynamics, perception, and control. We specify falsifiable hypotheses, define evaluation protocols, and detail a practical end-to-end system design spanning data acquisition (public archives, partnerships, hosted payloads, and custom small satellites), preprocessing and noise modeling, model integration, and cost and governance considerations. The intended outcome is a reproducible benchmark and an engineering blueprint that can be validated or rejected via controlled experiments.

Motivated by this, we undertake a systematic investigation on the complexity of sampling from the result of an acyclic join under equality conditions given only at runtime. When conditions are conjunctive, the goal is to understand when it is possible to precompute a feasible structure that uses O (IN) space and supports sampling in O (1) time, where IN is the input size. We present a dichotomy to characterize (subject to a widely-accepted conjecture) the existence of such structures based on the conditions supplied and, in every feasible scenario, give an optimal structure of O (IN) space and O (1) sample time.

We solve the problem of lower bounding query time in two steps: first, we use probabilistic tools to control the effect of sampling when the database attribute is drawn from a probability distribution.

Within this framework, we derive lower bounds under a range of modeling and distributional assumptions, paying particular attention to the case of piecewise linear and piecewise constant model classes, which are common in practical implementations.
