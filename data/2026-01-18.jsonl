STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs."}

Many resources are created using vocabularies that are FAIR-compliant and well-annotated, yet the collective ecosystem of these resources often fails to interoperate effectively in practice. This continued challenge is mainly due to variation in identifier schemas and data models used in these resources. We have created two tools to bridge the chasm between interoperability in principle and interoperation in practice. Babel solves the problem of multiple identifier schemes by producing a curated set of identifier mappings to create cliques of equivalent identifiers that are exposed through high-performance APIs. ORION solves the problems of multiple data models by ingesting knowledge bases and transforming them into a common, community-managed data model. Here, we describe Babel and ORION and demonstrate their ability to support data interoperation. A library of fully interoperable knowledge bases created through the application of Babel and ORION is available for download and use at https://robokop.renci.org."}

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods."}

We further present a static analysis tool to identify the merging opportunity without violating isolation as well as our experience of re-writing transactions in TPC-C and Spree, a popular real-world application.

This counterintuitive success stems from the observation of the `Markovian' nature: advanced sequential recommenders coincidentally rely on the latest interaction to make predictions, while the historical interactions serve mainly as auxiliary cues for inferring the user's general, non-sequential identity. This characteristic necessitates the capabilities of a universal recommendation model to effectively summarize the user sequence, with particular emphasis on the latest interaction. MPT inherently has the potential to be universal and transferable. On the one hand, when trained to predict the next state of Markov chains, it acquires the capabilities to estimate transition probabilities from the context (one adaptive manner for summarizing sequences) and attend to the last state to ensure accurate state transitions. On the other hand, unlike the heterogeneous interaction data, an unlimited amount of controllable Markov chains is available to boost the model capacity.

Until recently ES had a shared-nothing architecture that relied on local disks to store cluster data such as index files, transaction logs, and cluster state metadata. In this stateful architecture, compute is coupled with storage, and this leads to different tiers (eg, hot, warm, cold, and frozen) of hardware and configurations that the administrator chooses from to balance cost, performance, and high availability. In this paper, we show the technical design of a new serverless architecture, focusing on decoupling compute from storage, and offloading data to an affordable highly available object store, while supporting the same APIs and read-after-write semantics. Specifically, we show why and how this stateless architecture simplifies the data tiers to just two: indexing and search. This architecture supports indexing and searching practically limitless data while scaling each tier independently. Furthermore, we describe how we wrap index data into a custom batch commit format onto the object store to decrease upload costs by up to 100x, how we batch transaction log uploads to decrease upload costs by up to 30x, and how we delete files from the object store.

They were based on batch-oriented Extract Transform Load (ETL) paradigms, tight coupled schema and monolithic governance models that are better suited to stability than agility. Nevertheless, the increasing regulatory complexity, impacts of the near-real time risk visibility requirements, and increasing cost of infrastructure have emanated inherent weaknesses of the legacy EDW architectures. At the same time, the emergence of hybrid cloud platforms, scalable object storage, distributed query engines, and workflow orchestration system has made it possible to make the paradigm shift toward Extract–Load–Transform (ELT), domain-driven data products, and decentralized ownership models. In spite of these developments, in numerous organizations, the pressure to modernize reporting pipes based on strong backward compatibility criteria, audit limitations and the operational risks of massive data migrations makes this a challenge. This paper gives a detailed blueprint of modernization in the process of moving the old EDW centric ETL architectures to the hybrid cloud ELT platforms to suit the risk, finance, and regulatory reporting. Its proposed solution integrates domain-driven data products and ELT pushdown transformations orchestrating control planes and explicit data contracts that is applied in an incremental fashion with a strangler pattern. The framework focuses on retrogressively compatible schemas, reconcilability determinacy, the rollback safety nets, and regulated cutover plans to provide continuous regulatory compliance. Using a wellorganized migration roadmap, cost and performance metrics and an official risk register, the paper will show how organizations can shorten report delivery cycles, enhance service-level agreement (SLA) compliance and minimize the overall cost of ownership without sacrificing auditability and strict governance.

As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the per-node energy consumption that is critical for energyconstrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes.

As enterprises deploy diverse AI agents for text, voice, and visual processing, the challenge shifts from mere capability to economic efficiency—ensuring the right agent, or combination of agents and humans, handles each customer interaction at the lowest possible cost while meeting quality and service-level agreement (SLA) targets. The research purpose is to design, model, and validate a dynamic routing system that makes real-time cost-quality trade-off decisions. Employing a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, we developed an\" Orchestrator Agent\" trained within a simulated multi-modal service environment. The environment modeled a contact center with varying inbound channels (chat, voice call, email with attachments), a pool of specialized AI agents (LLM for text, STT/TTS for voice, CV for image analysis), and human expert tiers with different cost profiles. The Orchestrator's goal was to minimize total operational cost while penalizing SLA breaches. Key findings indicate that the RL-based orchestrator achieved a 28.5% reduction in average handling cost per interaction and a 33% reduction in SLA violations compared to static priority-based and load-balancing routing policies. Furthermore, it developed sophisticated strategies, such as using cheap LLM agents for initial triage and escalating only complex sub-tasks to more expensive agents or humans.

The switching of the syngas H2/CO ratio can supply tailored feedstock for synthesizing diverse downstream chemicals. However, unsteady state, stochastic behavior, and plant-model mismatch characteristics of the downstream process complicate existing control strategies and operational management. This study addresses the critical challenge of intelligent operational management in stochastic syngas switching downstream (SSSD) processes characterized by strong stochasticity and dynamic losses. To this end, a pre-optimization-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control framework is proposed for autonomous economic and exergy (2E) management of SSSD process. First, a high-fidelity dynamic model of SSSD process is developed to simulate the stochastic behavior and dynamic losses of the system. Then, the optimization constraint algorithm is innovatively embedded into the DRL framework to obtain an optimized initial set of actions for each random reset. Finally, the agent is trained to interact with the dynamic model in pursuit of efficient exploration and reward, which produces an optimal control strategy. The proposed method reduces exergy destruction by 3.8 % and 2.1 % compared to proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and conventional DRL frameworks, while obtaining the minimum operating cost of $8542 and the most stable product control.

Finding the right optimization strategy to sustain growth, yield, and profit is one of the major issues with greenhouse production. Addressing this issue effectively requires a combination of advanced technologies, data-driven insights, and innovative management practices. The automated optimizations, which are often implemented using reinforcement learning algorithms, encounter issues with sample efficiency and robustness due to the time-consuming nature of the real-world simulation. Therefore, the goal of this research is to solve these issues by combining the soft actor critic (SAC) and Q learning algorithms to create an ensemble method. To properly optimize the worst-case inefficient samples, a discrete randomization and dropout module is included. The problem of sample efficiency and resilience is treated as a Mismatch Markov Decision Optimisation problem. The suggested model outperforms the current methods in handling the robustness and sample efficiency issues, according to an experimental evaluation.

Existing systems shy away from providing a user-intent knob mainly because they make resource allocation decisions as soon as a function is registered, when inputs to the function are mostly unavailable. We find that function performance and resource utilization can vary greatly (up to 6× in latency and 4.78× in utilization) across inputs. Thus, to enable intent-based serverless computing, our key insight is to delay making resource allocation decisions until after function inputs are available so that resources can be allocated independently for each input and resource type. We introduce ALAP, a resource management framework for serverless systems that makes decisions As Late As Possible to right-size each invocation and meet user-intent efficiently. ALAP uses an online learning agent to predict the required amount of resources to meet an invocation's constraints and schedules these right-sized containers in a cold-start-aware manner. For a range of functions and inputs, ALAP adapts to user intents: it reduces latency and cost by up to 17.5× (3× on avg.) and 13× (3.7× on avg.), respectively, and latency and cost SLO violations by 1.3-2.3× and 1.6-2.2×, respectively, while nearly eliminating CPU and memory waste compared to four state-of-the-art systems.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3772052.3772262&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=288017699043752018&ei=JKhraYHnM-qsieoPgq2L-Ac&scisig=AHkA5jSsUzw0goguTrQnZYwsNph1&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3772052.3772262&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=288017699043752018&ei=JKhraYHnM-qsieoPgq2L-Ac&scisig=AHkA5jSsUzw0goguTrQnZYwsNph1&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | P Sinha, K Kaffes, NJ Yadwadkar - … of the 2025 ACM Symposium on …, 2025 - dl.acm.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3772052.3772262", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Traditional methods are too focused on the specific goal of detection or segmentation, and seriously neglect the sustainability of energy consumption, cost and complexity. In this study, we present a sustainable method to understand unstructured paths and reconstruct them in 3D space and plan walkable routes through a low-cost monocular camera. Edges lines are detected. Contour candidate curves are extracted by the relative integrity of lines. Based on geometric orientation continuity and coverage, candidates are refined to get approximate contours, which are regarded as walkable regions. By analyzing the relative geometric constraints between different walkable contours, unstructured paths can be understood and reconstructed in 3D space and walkable routes can be planned. This method requires no prior training, and no calibration of the internal parameters of monocular camera, which has the sustainability of low power consumption and low cost. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method in terms of multiple dimensions such as energy consumption, cost and interaction ratio. The results show that the method not only can understand unstructured paths, but also its sustainability of low power, low cost, and lightweight are more suitable for a resource-constrained system in field environments.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00354-026-00317-9&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=178699044167383675&ei=JKhraYHnM-qsieoPgq2L-Ac&scisig=AHkA5jRESHO5-jTeD1Dtklbi03aw&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=6&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00354-026-00317-9&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=178699044167383675&ei=JKhraYHnM-qsieoPgq2L-Ac&scisig=AHkA5jRESHO5-jTeD1Dtklbi03aw&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=6&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | L Wang, J Wu, S Wang, H Wei - New Generation Computing, 2026 - Springer", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00354-026-00317-9", "scholar_enhanced": true}

In this context, computational methods are instrumental in deriving quantitative indicators from process data and supporting data-driven decision-making. Computational, including optimization-based, methods are commonly employed to quantify and compare the performance of alternative processes. However, most existing studies focus on specific use cases, resulting in fragmented insights. Therefore, this paper surveys state-of-the-art data-and model-driven methods used to quantify sustainability performance in unit manufacturing processes. Specifically, we review sustainability evaluation methods applied to three major categories of unit manufacturing processes: additive, subtractive, and formative. We highlight that life cycle assessment (LCA) is effective for quantitative environmental system assessment; however, compiling reliable life cycle inventories is time-consuming and often requires proprietary software tools. In contrast, bottom-up parametric modeling approaches, which describe system behavior based on individual process parameters, have proved effective in evaluating complex systems and enabling flexible what-if analyses. The paper further investigates the integration of these modeling methods with data-driven analytical approaches such as multi-criteria decision-making and artificial intelligence–based algorithms for extracting actionable information.
