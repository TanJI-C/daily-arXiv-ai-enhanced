Talburt", "Muzakkiruddin Ahmed Mohammed", "Mert Can Cakmak", "Onais Khan Mohammed", "Mahboob Khan Mohammed", "Khizer Syed", "Leon Claasssens"], "title": "Case Count Metric for Comparative Analysis of Entity Resolution Results", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper describes a new process and software system, the Case Count Metric System (CCMS), for systematically comparing and analyzing the outcomes of two different ER clustering processes acting on the same dataset when the true linking (labeling) is not known. The CCMS produces a set of counts that describe how the clusters produced by the first process are transformed by the second process based on four possible transformation scenarios. The transformations are that a cluster formed in the first process either remains unchanged, merges into a larger cluster, is partitioned into smaller clusters, or otherwise overlaps with multiple clusters formed in the second process. The CCMS produces a count for each of these cases, accounting for every cluster formed in the first process. In addition, when run in analysis mode, the CCMS program can assist the user in evaluating these changes by displaying the details for all changes or only for certain types of changes. The paper includes a detailed description of the CCMS process and program and examples of how the CCMS has been applied in university and industry research."}

Recent state-of-the-art solutions leverage large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality answers. However, most rely on proprietary, large-scale LLMs with costly API access, posing a significant financial barrier. This paper instead focuses on TQA with smaller, open-weight LLMs that can run on a desktop or laptop. This setting is challenging, as such LLMs typically have weaker capabilities than large proprietary models, leading to substantial performance degradation with existing methods.\n  We observe that a key reason for this degradation is that prior approaches often require the LLM to solve a highly sophisticated task using long, complex prompts, which exceed the capabilities of small open-weight LLMs. Motivated by this observation, we present Orchestra, a multi-agent approach that unlocks the potential of accessible LLMs for high-quality, cost-effective TQA. Orchestra coordinates a group of LLM agents, each responsible for a relatively simple task, through a structured, layered workflow to solve complex TQA problems -- akin to an orchestra. By reducing the prompt complexity faced by each agent, Orchestra significantly improves output reliability.\n  We implement Orchestra on top of AgentScope, an open-source multi-agent framework, and evaluate it on multiple TQA benchmarks using a wide range of open-weight LLMs. Experimental results show that Orchestra achieves strong performance even with small- to medium-sized models. For example, with Qwen2.5-14B, Orchestra reaches 72.1% accuracy on WikiTQ, approaching the best prior result of 75.3% achieved with GPT-4; with larger Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek models, Orchestra outperforms all prior methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks."}

While dense ANNS has been optimized using specialized hardware accelerators, sparse ANNS remains limited by CPU-based implementations, hindering scalability. This limitation is increasingly critical as hybrid retrieval systems, combining sparse and dense embeddings, become standard in Information Retrieval (IR) pipelines. We propose SpANNS, a near-memory processing architecture for sparse ANNS. SpANNS combines a hybrid inverted index with efficient query management and runtime optimizations. The architecture is built on a CXL Type-2 near-memory platform, where a specialized controller manages query parsing and cluster filtering, while compute-enabled DIMMs perform index traversal and distance computations close to the data. It achieves 15.2x to 21.6x faster execution over the state-of-the-art CPU baselines, offering scalable and efficient solutions for sparse vector search."}
