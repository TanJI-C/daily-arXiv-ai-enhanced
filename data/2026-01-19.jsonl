To address these challenges, this paper proposes HiSem-RAG, a hierarchical semantic-driven RAG method. It comprises three key modules: (1) hierarchical semantic indexing, which preserves boundaries and relationships between sections and paragraphs to reconstruct document context; (2) a bidirectional semantic enhancement mechanism that incorporates titles and summaries to facilitate two-way information flow; and (3) a distribution-aware adaptive threshold strategy that dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on similarity distributions, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency. On the domain-specific EleQA dataset, HiSem-RAG achieves 82.00% accuracy, outperforming HyDE and RAPTOR by 5.04% and 3.98%, respectively, with reduced computational costs. On the LongQA dataset, it attains a ROUGE-L score of 0.599 and a BERT_F1 score of 0.839.

Three persistence configurations—SQL with indexing, SQL without indexing, and a document-oriented NoSQL database, including supplementary hybrid SQL variants used for robustness analysis—are assessed across read-dominant, write-dominant, and mixed workloads, with concurrency levels ranging from low to high contention. The experimental setup is fully containerized and executed in a single-node environment to isolate persistence-layer behavior and ensure reproducibility. System performance is evaluated using multiple metrics, including percentile-based latency (p95), throughput, CPU utilization, and memory consumption. The results reveal distinct performance trade-offs among the evaluated configurations, highlighting the sensitivity of persistence mechanisms to workload composition and concurrency intensity. In particular, indexing strategies significantly affect read-heavy scenarios, while document-oriented persistence demonstrates advantages under write-intensive workloads. The findings emphasize the importance of workload-aware persistence selection in microservice-based systems and support the adoption of polyglot persistence strategies.

Addressing these challenges is essential to meet Green IT standards and ensure sustainable computing practices. This thesis introduces a novel approach to energy consumption prediction, providing a non-intrusive method for assessing the energy usage of containerized environments. The primary focus of this work is on developing a model capable of accurately predicting the energy consumption of container-based solutions using their expected command as the main feature. Using an extensive dataset encompassing metrics such as voltage, current, power, frequency, energy, and power factor, various regression models were evaluated to determine the most effective approach. The selected model leverages these measurements to forecast future energy consumption over extended periods, offering actionable insights into energy usage patterns. This predictive framework empowers users to optimize resource allocation, reduce energy costs, and enhance IT equipment efficiency. By applying advanced feature importance analysis and hyperparameter optimization, the study highlights critical features influencing energy consumption, such as CPU and memory usage rates.

These parameters are crucial for evaluating consensus costs but have traditionally depended on subjective moderator judgments, inevitably introducing bias and compromising decision objectivity. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel deep learning approach to consensus cost modeling through deep feature extraction. We propose a deep neural network-based consensus cost model and soft consensus-reaching framework. This framework seeks to develop a data-driven mechanism that autonomously learns objective consensus cost parameters and expert weights distributions from decision-making data. The proposed models eliminate human subjectivity in parameter determination, establishing the first application of deep learning to learn these critical parameters in the minimum cost consensus studies. The usefulness of the proposed model is demonstrated through simulation experiment and case study. The robustness and effectiveness of the model are also examined.

Link-level studies that maximize ergodic rate often assume these costs are negligible, leading to non-viable solutions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel, cost-aware two-timescale framework that optimizes for net utility, balancing network-wide Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE) against the practical reconfiguration costs. We formulate a scalable optimization problem based on statistical CSI and a probabilistic port-selection surrogate, which is solved efficiently via projected-gradient methods. We then propose three specialized strategies—Interference-Aware (IADP), Load-Balanced (LBSD), and Multi-Objective (MOPO)—that optimize this new utility. System-level simulations in ultra-dense B5G scenarios show our framework achieves substantial gains in net ASE and user throughput, while the explicit cost penalties provably control switching activity and pilot burden, unlike cost-ignorant baselines.

Simulations show that improving the rate of penetration (ROP) by 20 m/day can cut drilling costs by $1.5–$3 million per well. Effective stimulation may boost energy yield by 25%–40%, enhancing NPV by up to $60 million under favorable electricity prices. Reservoir depth, stimulation success, and thermal recovery shape the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), which ranges from $82/MWh in typical cases to below $65/MWh with advanced drilling and reinjection. A 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) further reduces LCOE by 15%–22% and improves NPV by $20–$45 million. Thermal sustainability hinges on managing reinjection temperatures and flow rates to avoid early cooling. EGS progress stems from steady advancements in drilling, stimulation, and surface systems like Kalina cycles. Yet challenges persist slow deep drilling, stimulation risks, and high CAPEX. Derisking deep or marginal sites requires modular design, faster permitting, and tax credits.

To address these issues, various approaches have been explored, including Design of Experiments (DOE), numerical simulations, data-driven methods, and the emerging technology of Digital Twin (DT) – a virtual replica of a physical entity enabling bi-directional data exchange and real-time interaction. It stands out by offering integrated monitoring, control, and predictive capabilities. Despite recent advancements, DTs in AM remain underdeveloped, especially in addressing quality concerns. This systematic review comprehensively focuses on DTs specifically designed to enhance AM part quality – an area overlooked in previous reviews. We examine critical DT development stages, including design, implementation, data processing and intelligence, and verification and validation. Our analysis reveals two key findings. First, only 16 studies from the literature meet the strict criteria for quality-centric, bi-directional DTs, highlighting the field’s immaturity and fragmentation. Second, most implementations are process-specific, with limited multitasking capabilities and over-reliance on sensor data, inadequately addressing critical quality attributes. Based on these findings, we propose six future research directions, namely establishing a comprehensive quality-focused DT framework, integrating multiscale modelling, enabling smarter DTs, creating a unified platform for diverse AM processes, improving data synchronisation, and enhancing data security.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/27525783.2026.2613469&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=7251508217334794962&ei=kaVsadDnF7ux6rQPmKbEyA4&scisig=AHkA5jR-2_aW6u4kuwbNfUwCEwxg&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=6&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/27525783.2026.2613469&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=7251508217334794962&ei=kaVsadDnF7ux6rQPmKbEyA4&scisig=AHkA5jR-2_aW6u4kuwbNfUwCEwxg&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=6&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | MV Ehteshamfar, X Xu, S Yang - Digital Twin, 2026 - Taylor & Francis", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/27525783.2026.2613469", "scholar_enhanced": true}
