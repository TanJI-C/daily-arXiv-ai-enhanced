However, this potential is yet to be realized as KGs are notoriously difficult to interact with via their query language SPARQL for many user groups alike. Additionally, a further hindrance for user-KG interaction is the fundamental disconnect between user requirements and requirements KGs have to fulfill regarding machine-interoperability, reasoning tasks, querying, and further technical requirements. Thus, many statements in a KG are of no semantic significance for end users. In this work, we investigate a potential remedy for this challenge: Semantic Units (SUs) are semantically significant, named subgraphs in a KG with the goal to enhance cognitive interoperability for users, and to provide responses to common KG modelling challenges. We model and construct a KG from publication and dataset metadata of the Biodiversity Exploratories (BE), a research platform for functional biodiversity research across research plots in Germany to contribute to biodiversity research from the perspective of computer science. We contribute further by delivering the first implementation of semantic units on a knowledge graph and investigate how SUs impact KG querying. Finally, we present two implementations of tasks that show how large language models (LLMs) can be used to extract structured metadata categories from publication and dataset titles and abstracts, and how embedding models can be used to enrich metadata with latent information, in an effort to support the creation of structured and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) metadata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u201d\uff08Semantic Units, SUs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u547d\u540d\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6001\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5fb7\u56fdBiodiversity Exploratories\u9879\u76ee\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0SUs\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6587\u732e\u6807\u9898/\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u589e\u5f3aFAIR\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KGs\uff09\u867d\u5728\u751f\u6001\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6574\u5408\u6570\u636e\u3001\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u591a\u6570\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u4e14KG\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\u5e38\u4e0e\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9700\u6c42\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u56fe\u8c31\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fb7\u56fdBiodiversity Exploratories\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u201d\uff08SUs\uff09\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7684\u547d\u540d\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ece\u6807\u9898\u548c\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301FAIR\u539f\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SUs\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4e0eKG\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001FAIR\u517c\u5bb9\u5143\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u4e3a\u5f25\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8bed\u4e49\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u7684FAIR\u5316\u3002"}}

While there are many sources for this, a major one is the contention for resources. And this cost increases with load as conflicting operations more frequently try to access data concurrently. Traditional latch-based approaches usually handle these situations by blocking one or more contending threads. Latch-free techniques can avoid this behavior. But the payoff may be limited if latch-free techniques require executing wasted work. In this paper, we show how latch-free techniques exploit delta record updating and can significantly reduce wasted work by using notices, a new latch-free approach. This paper explains how notices work and can solve B-tree index maintenance problems, while avoiding thread switches or stalls. Other opportunities for avoiding thread switches or stalls are also discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cnotices\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u9501\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u66f4\u65b0\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5207\u6362\u6216\u505c\u987f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u8017\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8eB\u6811\u7d22\u5f15\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9501\uff08latch-based\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u4e0b\u56e0\u8d44\u6e90\u4e89\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ebf\u7a0b\u963b\u585e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u9501\uff08latch-free\uff09\u6280\u672f\u867d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u963b\u585e\uff0c\u5374\u5e38\u56e0\u6267\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u800c\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5207\u6362/\u505c\u987f\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6d6a\u8d39\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u53d1\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u201cnotices\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u9501\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408delta record updating\uff08\u589e\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728B\u6811\u7d22\u5f15\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b49\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u53d1\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u7ebf\u7a0b\u963b\u585e\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65e0\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3B\u6811\u7d22\u5f15\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u56e0\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5207\u6362\u6216\u505c\u987f\u9020\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u9501\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6d6a\u8d39\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "Notices\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u9501\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u7ef4\u62a4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u907f\u514d\u7ebf\u7a0b\u963b\u585e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing online parsers are architecturally unsuited for the dynamism of production environments. Built on fundamentally static template models, they are dangerously brittle: minor schema drifts silently break parsing pipelines, leading to lost alerts and operational toil. We propose \\textbf{KELP} (\\textbf{K}elp \\textbf{E}volutionary \\textbf{L}og \\textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput.

Compression schemes must be able to exploit the similarity, or smoothness, of consecutive numbers and must be able to contend with extreme conditions, such as high-precision values or the absence of smoothness. We present DeXOR, a novel framework that enables decimal XOR procedure to encode decimal-space longest common prefixes and suffixes, achieving optimal prefix reuse and effective redundancy elimination. To ensure accurate and low-cost decompression even with binary-decimal conversion errors, DeXOR incorporates 1) scaled truncation with error-tolerant rounding and 2) different bit management strategies optimized for decimal XOR. Additionally, a robust exception handler enhances stability by managing floating-point exponents, maintaining high compression ratios under extreme conditions. In evaluations across 22 datasets, DeXOR surpasses state-of-the-art schemes, achieving a 15% higher compression ratio and a 20% faster decompression speed while maintaining a competitive compression speed. DeXOR also offers scalability under varying conditions and exhibits robustness in extreme scenarios where other schemes fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeXOR is a novel compression framework for streaming floating-point numbers that leverages decimal XOR to encode common prefixes and suffixes, achieving higher compression ratios and faster decompression than existing methods while remaining robust under extreme conditions.", "motivation": "Streaming floating-point data is increasingly common, yet existing compression techniques struggle with high-precision values or lack of smoothness between consecutive numbers.
