A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer \"why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL.

Introduction This research describes a literacy learning strategy using a'Class Literacy Tree'(POLIKEL) to support the'One Week One Book'(SAMI SAKU) program and its impact on the reading interest and literacy skills of fifth-grade elementary students. Method A qualitative, descriptive case study design was employed at two elementary schools in Sumedang Regency, Indonesia. Data were collected via observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation analysis, then analyzed using an interactive model. Results The'Class Literacy Tree'strategy successfully creates a joyful, participatory, and goal-oriented learning environment. The program effectively fosters continuous reading and writing habits, with teachers acting as crucial facilitators. Students' consistent, tangible engagement with the'tree'demonstrated marked improvement in reading interest, comprehension of intrinsic text elements, and basic writing skills. Discussion The strategy's success is contingent on a supporting management cycle strong school leadership, validating the PDCA cycle as a framework for sustainable pedagogical innovation. This strategy serves as an effective, sustainable, and scalable alternative model to enhance foundational literacy in elementary education.\n\n\n\n", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://jse.rezkimedia.org/index.php/jse/article/download/707/258&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=2159830123818094372&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jReZdsox4Zw76HkptOp1z7O&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://jse.rezkimedia.org/index.php/jse/article/download/707/258&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=2159830123818094372&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jReZdsox4Zw76HkptOp1z7O&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | N Sumartina, H Hidayat - Journal of Science and Education (JSE \u2026, 2026 - jse.rezkimedia.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://jse.rezkimedia.org/index.php/jse/article/view/707", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u73ed\u7ea7\u8bc6\u5b57\u6811\u201d\uff08POLIKEL\uff09\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u201c\u4e00\u5468\u4e00\u4e66\u201d\uff08SAMI SAKU\uff09\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5728\u5370\u5c3c\u82cf\u95e8\u5f53\u53bf\u4e24\u6240\u5c0f\u5b66\u4e94\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u5174\u8da3\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u5199\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b63\u5f0f\u6559\u80b2\u5e38\u56e0\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u57f9\u517b\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u8bfb\u5199\u7d20\u517b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d28\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5370\u5c3c\u82cf\u95e8\u5f53\u53bf\u4e24\u6240\u5c0f\u5b66\u5f00\u5c55\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u6587\u6863\u5206\u6790\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u201c\u73ed\u7ea7\u8bc6\u5b57\u6811\u201d\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u529f\u8425\u9020\u4e86\u6109\u60a6\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u751f\u6301\u7eed\u9605\u8bfb\u4e0e\u5199\u4f5c\u4e60\u60ef\u7684\u517b\u6210\uff1b\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u5174\u8da3\u3001\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5728\u8981\u7d20\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u5199\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5b66\u6821\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u6027\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PDCA\u5faa\u73af\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6559\u5b66\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u8bfb\u5199\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

A comprehensive tool is developed, combining long-term scenario generation using the TimeGAN deep learning model with multi-objective stochastic optimization of the energy system. To address TimeGAN\u2019s limitations on long sequences, a dedicated preprocessing step based on frequency decomposition is introduced, enabling the capture of multi-scale patterns in climatic and consumption data. The generated synthetic scenarios are rigorously validated using statistical and spectral criteria, and are then used as inputs for the sizing phase. The methodology is applied to a real case study on La R\u00e9union Island, demonstrating its effectiveness for designing autonomous, low-carbon, and uncertainty-resilient energy systems.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://theses.hal.science/tel-05450784/file/EBNOU.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13400850301655297292&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jTGW6DaqZEaEEkeV6Xkf7PH&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://theses.hal.science/tel-05450784/file/EBNOU.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13400850301655297292&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jTGW6DaqZEaEEkeV6Xkf7PH&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | H Ebnou - 2025 - theses.hal.science", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://theses.hal.science/tel-05450784/", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408TimeGAN\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7559\u5c3c\u6c6a\u5c9b\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u78b3\u3001\u6297\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u79bb\u5cb8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u5728\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u53d1\u7535\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u517c\u987e\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u4e0e\u7528\u7535\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528TimeGAN\u751f\u6210\u957f\u671f\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u573a\u666f\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u98ce\u7535\u3001\u5149\u4f0f\u3001\u50a8\u80fd\u3001\u67f4\u6cb9\uff09\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7559\u5c3c\u6c6a\u5c9b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u78b3\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u3001TimeGAN\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u5b64\u7acb\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u4f4e\u78b3\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
{"id": "scholar_0634ccc335c3749faa970c3bbfa56b65", "title": "The Impact of Distributed Data Query Optimization on Large-Scale Data Processing", "authors": ["J Li"], "summary": "With the rapid advancement of big data technology, distributed architecture has become the mainstream in the industry when processing massive amounts of information. However, when dealing with such large datasets, the query efficiency and performance of the system become key factors that constrain its response speed and accuracy. This study analyzed the key performance bottlenecks of distributed data queries, such as storage response latency, hardware processing capacity limits, and data consistency assurance. Based on this, a series of targeted improvement measures were proposed. Specifically, in terms of distributed storage network latency, hardware resource upgrade requirements, and data consistency maintenance, research has proposed solutions such as optimizing data distribution, regularly upgrading hardware facilities, and adopting distributed locking strategies. After implementing these optimization measures, query response can be accelerated, data accuracy can be ensured, and hardware costs and maintenance expenses can be reduced. The research results show that these optimization methods can enhance the overall performance of processing large-scale data systems.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://scholar-press.com/uploads/papers/MqdQVq1D1qRjjKwMLwfUca9PGUaGXxdTmWlltc1C.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=17354762022946573543&ei=hKtlaaWUIbux6rQP76-2-Qc&scisig=AHkA5jTdYYxy8ewfQL1lqWCldK0J&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://scholar-press.com/uploads/papers/MqdQVq1D1qRjjKwMLwfUca9PGUaGXxdTmWlltc1C.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=17354762022946573543&ei=hKtlaaWUIbux6rQP76-2-Qc&scisig=AHkA5jTdYYxy8ewfQL1lqWCldK0J&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | J Li - 2025 - scholar-press.com", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "http://scholar-press.com/uploads/papers/MqdQVq1D1qRjjKwMLwfUca9PGUaGXxdTmWlltc1C.pdf", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u62ec\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5347\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9501\u7b49\u6539\u8fdb\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6570\u636e\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5b58\u50a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u5347\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9501\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u65bd\u4f18\u5316\u63aa\u65bd\u540e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u67e5\u8be2\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0e\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
