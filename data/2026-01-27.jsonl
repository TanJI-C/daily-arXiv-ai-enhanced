The domains of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics have also undergone a similar phenomenon through the advent of large foundational models in the form of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Vision Language Action models (VLAs), respectively. In this paper, we investigate the current state of Artificial Intelligence for Database Systems research (AI4DB), and assess how far AI4DB systems are from achieving their own Move\\,37 moment. We envision a Generative Database Agent (Gen-DBA, for short) as the pathway to achieving Move\\,37 for database systems that will bring generative reasoning and creativity into the realm of database learning tasks. This vision paper explores this direction by presenting the recipe for building Gen-DBA that encompasses but is not limited to a Transformer backbone, a hardware-grounded tokenization mechanism, a two-stage Goal-Directed Next Token Prediction training paradigm, and a generative inference process."}

SQL is highly optimized for processing structured data laid out in relations. Meanwhile, in the present application development landscape, it is highly desirable to utilize the power of learned models to perform complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to understand and extract information from unstructured textual data. However, SQL as a query language and accompanying relational database systems are either incompatible or inefficient for workloads that require leveraging learned models. This results in complex engineering and multiple data migration operations that move data between the data sources and the model inference platform. In this paper, we present iPDB, a relational system that supports in-database machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) inferencing using extended SQL syntax. In iPDB, LLMs and ML calls can function as semantic projects, as predicates to perform semantic selects and semantic joins, or for semantic grouping in group-by clauses. iPDB has a novel relational predict operator and semantic query optimizations that enable users to write and efficiently execute semantic SQL queries, outperforming the state-of-the-art."}

Mohammed", "Abdallah Alsammani"], "title": "A Scalable Transaction Management Framework for Consistent Document-Oriented NoSQL Databases", "comment": null, "summary": "NoSQL databases are widely used in modern applications due to their scalability and schema flexibility, yet they often rely on eventual consistency models that limit reliable transaction processing. This study proposes a four-stage transaction management framework for document-oriented NoSQL databases, with MongoDB as the reference platform. The framework combines transaction lifecycle management, operation classification, pre-execution conflict detection, and an adaptive locking strategy with timeout-based deadlock prevention. Formal correctness analysis shows that the proposed approach guarantees conflict serializability under defined conditions. An experimental evaluation using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) workloads A, B, and F, with concurrency levels ranging from 1 to 100 clients, demonstrates a reduction in transaction abort rates from 8.3% to 4.7%, the elimination of observed deadlocks, and a 34.2% decrease in latency variance. Throughput improvements ranging from 6.3% to 18.4% are observed under high concurrency, particularly for read-modify-write workloads. Distributed experiments on clusters of up to 9 nodes confirm scalability, achieving 15.2% higher throughput and 53% lower abort rates than baseline systems. Comparisons with MongoDB's native transactions, CockroachDB, and TiDB indicate that the proposed framework strikes a good balance between consistency guarantees and performance overhead. Sensitivity analysis identifies optimal parameter settings, including a lock timeout of 100 ms, an initial backoff of 10 ms, and a maximum backoff of 500 ms. These results show that carefully designed consistency mechanisms can significantly improve data integrity in NoSQL systems without undermining scalability."}

Despite three decades of standardization efforts, over 40 metadata schemas now span the building lifecycle, with fragmentation accelerating rather than resolving. Current approaches rely on point-to-point mappings that scale quadratically with the number of schemas, or universal ontologies that become unwieldy monoliths. The fundamental gap is the absence of mathematical foundations for structure-preserving transformations across heterogeneous building data. Here we show that category theory provides these foundations, enabling systematic data integration with $O(n)$ specification complexity for $n$ ontologies. We formalize building ontologies as first-order theories and demonstrate two proof-of-concept implementations in Categorical Query Language (CQL): 1) generating BRICK models from IFC design data at commissioning, and 2) three-way integration of IFC, BRICK, and RealEstateCore where only two explicit mappings yield the third automatically through categorical composition. Our correct-by-construction approach treats property sets as first-class schema entities and provides automated bidirectional migrations, and enables cross-ontology queries. These results establish feasibility of categorical methods for building data integration and suggest a path toward an app ecosystem for buildings, where mathematical foundations enable reliable component integration analogous to smartphone platforms."}

However, due to privacy concerns, data encryption prior to outsourcing is an important means of protection, which in turn requires performing queries over the encrypted data. While several approaches do offer support for privacy preserving skyline or top-k queries, they typically struggle with efficiency when extended to secure top-k dominating queries, due to the inherent nature of combining the advantages of both top k and skyline queries. Nevertheless, this nature renders them as a more practical and promising alternative for location-based services. To address this, we introduce STLD, a secure top-k location-based dominating query scheme. Specifically, we develop an innovative index structure called Secure Aggregate R-tree (SAR-tree) by utilizing the Paillier cryptosystem and introducing meticulously crafted noise, while also incorporating principles from aggregate R-trees and semi-blind R-trees. Leveraging this structure, we propose a series of secure sub-protocols to facilitate top-k dominating queries, accompanied by optimization techniques to mitigate latency associated with computationally intensive dominating operations. Given an encrypted query, STLD not only efficiently answers the query but also guarantees the privacy of data(sets), results, queries and access patterns. Finally, STLD undergoes rigorous theoretical security and complexity analysis, complemented by empirical evaluations that demonstrate its performance and feasibility, achieving a reduction in query cost by 40%-60% compared to multiple competing methods.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11347495/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13932546995748641347&ei=y4t2abaEPd_YieoP1b6liQE&scisig=AHkA5jRPXi6O8uZVssFfBgY_EwZx&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11347495/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13932546995748641347&ei=y4t2abaEPd_YieoP1b6liQE&scisig=AHkA5jRPXi6O8uZVssFfBgY_EwZx&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Z Wang, X Ding, W Song, P Zhou… - … on Dependable and …, 2026 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11347495/", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Yet, these systems struggle to scale in realistic enterprise settings with large, complex schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and expensive multi-step reasoning. Emerging agentic approaches show potential for adaptive reasoning but often suffer from inefficiency and instability-repeating interactions with databases, producing inconsistent outputs, and occasionally failing to generate valid answers. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark.

In the retrieval phase, a hybrid retrieval strategy is employed by combining sparse and dense retrieval paradigms. Within the dense retrieval component, Matryoshka representation learning and self-attention enhancement are introduced to extend the conventional encoder architecture, thereby improving the model’s adaptability and semantic representation capacity. Experimental evaluations were conducted using DeepSeek-V3-Chat as the baseline model on the UltraDomain QA dataset, covering two vertical domains—science and healthcare. The proposed framework achieved an average improvement of 3 percentage points in F1-score and approximately 10 percentage points in answer relevance, while maintaining consistent factual faithfulness.

Thus, it is critical to optimize query performance within cloud environment and reduce metadata redundancy.\nIn this paper, we propose CloudTS, which is a novel timeseries data storage model with query optimization for cloud storage. CloudTS separately manages metadata and data, and introduces an efficient global metadata management for both space saving and query speedup. CloudTS also transparently supports the time-partitioned tag-based query model in performance monitoring timeseries systems. For metadata, a global tag dictionary is built to reduce metadata redundancy and a novel timeseries-tag mapping technique with a twodimension bitmap is designed so the mapping of timeseries and tags can be efficiently accomplished to support tag-based queries. For data, the compressed data chunks are put into objects by timeseries group. We have implemented a fully functional prototype of CloudTS and evaluated it with production timeseries data and synthetic workloads based on Amazon S3. In comparison, Cortex, a cloud-based timeseries system widely adopted by industries, and Apache Parquet and JSON Time Series, two representative cloud storage formats, are utilized in the evaluation.

A single database system therefore fails to deliver the necessary balance of latency, scalability, and resiliency expected by contemporary workloads. One effective solution is polyglot service persistence, an approach where multiple database engines coexist within the same system to leverage the individual strengths of each. In this paper, we introduce the development of a hybrid platform that unifies several database types—together with a distributed file store—through a micro-services architecture. This strategy yields an adaptable, horizontally scalable solution capable of satisfying heterogeneous data requirements while simplifying operational overhead. Our methodology centres on a framework that exposes a unified interface to all underlying datastores, so end users can manage relational, document, and file-based data without installing or configuring each engine individually; connection logic, driver management, and schema coordination are fully abstracted. In addition, it synthesises fully documented REST APIs for every generated schema, enabling seamless CRUD operations across all underlying stores. The hybrid system is engineered to optimise every database model’s forte: transactional consistency in relational stores, elastic growth for schema-less datasets in document stores, and built-in redundancy plus fault tolerance for large files in distributed storage.

While the exchange of raw data is often avoided due to privacy and regulatory concerns, many distributed workflows still require large-scale data movement or model updates that demand predictable network performance. This paper investigates the trade-off between earliest completion time (ECT) and communication cost in data transfers that leverage bandwidth reservation on fixed paths with variable bandwidth in dedicated high-performance networks. We fo-cus on two representative scheduling objectives relevant to distributed learning and data-intensive cloud workflows: (i) minimizing communication cost while meeting a transfer dead-line, and (ii) achieving the ECT while respecting a maximum cost budget. We prove that both scheduling problems are NP-complete and propose heuristic algorithms to address them effectively.

However, previous software projects' effort estimation methods, such as source lines of code and function point size metrics, have limitations in estimating effort at the specification stage. A machine learning-based object point analysis technique for software effort estimation is the earliest technique to predict software project effort at the specification stage. Even object point analysis software and effort estimation techniques using machine learning algorithms can make effort predictions at an earlier stage. Still, they have some accuracy limitations compared to the actual effort. However, deep learning models showed better accuracy in effort estimation near the actual effort at the earliest specification stage. This work advances the state-of-the-art by combining OPA’s simplicity with DNN’s predictive power, offering a practical solution for industry adoption.

These low-altitude operational scenarios require precise and efficient UAV swarm coordination, making autonomous flight control a key challenge. In this work, we investigate a distributed UAV swarm flight control problem in which each UAV autonomously makes decisions based on partial observations of neighboring UAVs and the surrounding environment. This problem involves multi-objective optimization, as the goal is to simultaneously minimize the cost of UAV control and maximize the speed of UAV service activation. To address the inefficiency of traditional reinforcement learning for this multi-objective problem when confronted with fluctuating low-altitude environmental conditions, we propose a distributed autonomous control method based on evolutionary multi-agent multi-objective reinforcement learning (EMAMORL). This approach integrates distributed intelligence with multi-objective reinforcement learning to generate numerous policies for distinct preferences for different objectives in a single iteration while reducing communication and control overheads. During the online inference phase, agents use these trained policies for real-time decision-making.

While early models relied on dense operations, techniques like pruning have introduced sparsity, leading to a mix of dense and sparse operator types. Most existing accelerators are specialized for specific operators and perform poorly in mixed scenarios, while those supporting multiple operators often lack flexibility and suffer from suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose VersaAccel, a configurable accelerator for sparse and dense matrix operators. It supports four distinct configurations, each optimized for a set of operators. A key feature of our design is its adaptive configuration selection mechanism, driven by a lightweight cost model that explicitly evaluates the performance-energy trade-off between available options. This allows VersaAccel to dynamically choose the most efficient configuration—opting for higher performance when the gain outweighs the energy cost, or prioritizing energy efficiency when appropriate. Experimental results demonstrate that VersaAccel achieves an average performance/area improvement of 3.10× across multiple operators (MV, MM, SPMV, SpMM, SpMSpM) and 4.06× on full model evaluations (ResNet18, VGG16, LLaMA2-7B, BERT-Base), compared to mainstream accelerators.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11272451/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=3998206704442045118&ei=cKB3aerIB4eUywS5-prpDw&scisig=AHkA5jTfgip8nxuH6JMETrcS8PsC&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=9&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11272451/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=3998206704442045118&ei=cKB3aerIB4eUywS5-prpDw&scisig=AHkA5jTfgip8nxuH6JMETrcS8PsC&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=9&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | M Tang, M Wen - … Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of …, 2025 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11272451/", "scholar_enhanced": true}

We design two query methods, SAS and SAS+, which exploit the embedded synopsis to return exact or approximate results more efficiently than traditional approaches.

Experiments show that our approach achieves up to 97.9% faster performance on approximate queries compared with baseline PostgreSQL when the synopsis satisfies the query constraints and required derivative attributes.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/6287639/11323511/11316635.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=14646791791491727212&ei=N_13aeSDI6Oi6rQPoMCXoAE&scisig=AHkA5jRPszudbQLTH4RygZXN4FwX&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/6287639/11323511/11316635.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=14646791791491727212&ei=N_13aeSDI6Oi6rQPoMCXoAE&scisig=AHkA5jRPszudbQLTH4RygZXN4FwX&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | M Takata, H Yuasa, K Goda - IEEE Access, 2025 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11316635/", "scholar_enhanced": true}
