Unfortunately, traditional approaches such as fair sharing do not provide performance isolation for storage systems, because their resources (e.g., write buffers and read caches) exhibit high preemption delays. These delays lead to unacceptable spikes in client tail latencies, as clients may be forced to wait arbitrarily long to receive their fair share of resources.\n  We introduce Delta Fair Sharing, a family of algorithms for sharing resources with high preemption delays. These algorithms satisfy two key properties: $δ$-fairness, which bounds a client's delay in receiving its fair share of resources to $δ$ time units, and $δ$-Pareto-efficiency, which allocates unused resources to clients with unmet demand. Together, these properties capture resource-acquisition delays end-to-end, bound well-behaved clients' tail-latency spikes to $δ$ time units, and ensure high utilization. We implement such algorithms in FAIRDB, an extension of RocksDB. Our evaluation shows that FAIRDB isolates well-behaved clients from high-demand workloads better than state-of-the-art alternatives."}

Column names and descriptions are valuable for this task. LLMs can leverage such natural-language schema metadata. However, in many datasets, correct matching requires additional evidence beyond the column itself. Because it is impractical to provide an LLM with the entire schema metadata needed to capture this evidence, the core challenge becomes to select and organize the most useful contextual information.\n  We present ConStruM, a structure-guided framework for budgeted evidence packing in schema matching. ConStruM constructs a lightweight, reusable structure in which, at query time, it assembles a small context pack emphasizing the most discriminative evidence. ConStruM is designed as an add-on: given a shortlist of candidate targets produced by an upstream matcher, it augments the matcher's final LLM prompt with structured, query-specific evidence so that the final selection is better grounded. For this purpose, we develop a context tree for budgeted multi-level context retrieval and a global similarity hypergraph that surfaces groups of highly similar columns (on both the source and target sides), summarized via group-aware differentiation cues computed online or precomputed offline. Experiments on real datasets show that ConStruM improves matching by providing and organizing the right contextual evidence."}

While Active Learning (AL) offers a potential solution to this \"label scarcity\" problem, existing approaches introduce severe scalability bottlenecks. Specifically, they achieve high accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs by re-training complex models from scratch or solving NP-hard selection problems in every iteration. In this paper, we propose ALER, a novel, semi-supervised pipeline designed to bridge the gap between semantic accuracy and computational scalability. ALER eliminates the training bottleneck by using a frozen bi-encoder architecture to generate static embeddings once and then iteratively training a lightweight classifier on top. To address the memory bottleneck associated with large-scale candidate pools, we first select a representative sample of the data and then use K-Means to partition this sample into semantically coherent chunks, enabling an efficient AL loop. We further propose a hybrid query strategy that combines \"confused\" and \"confident\" pairs to efficiently refine the decision boundary while correcting high-confidence errors.Extensive evaluation demonstrates ALER's superior efficiency, particularly on the large-scale DBLP dataset: it accelerates the training loop by 1.3x while drastically reducing resolution latency by a factor of 3.8 compared to the fastest baseline."}

Block builders must then simply sequence transactions in priority order (from high to low priority), breaking ties however they would like. We show that this system is the unique system that satisfies five independent axioms."}

Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.

In this setting, users can take advantage of different services to support their intelligent applications. For example, edge resources offer low response latency. In contrast, cloud platforms provide low monetary cost computation resources for computation-intensive workloads. However, communication between DL model partitions can introduce transmission bottlenecks and pose risks of data leakage. Recent research aims to balance accuracy, computation delay, transmission delay, and privacy concerns. They address these issues with model compression, model distillation, transmission compression, and model architecture adaptations, including internal classifiers.

Its core difficulty lies in handling the deadline constraint, where existing methods suffer from two major issues: fixed deadline distribution strategies, which lack adaptability to diverse workflows, and inefficient metaheuristic search, which requires discrete encodings and repair rules in the combinatorial space. To overcome these limitations, we propose a continuous optimization approach to efficiently address the deadline constraint. The basic idea is to find the suitable sub-deadline of each task by iterative optimization for each workflow. First, treating each task’s sub-deadline as a decision variable, a continuous optimization problem is established to solve deadline-constrained workflow scheduling. Then, a Dynamic Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization with Social Learning (SL-DMSPSO) algorithm is proposed for this continuous optimization problem, incorporating with the following two novel designs: 1) the entire population is divided into multiple swarms and is re-divided at each iteration, ensuring that swarms are dynamic and randomly assigned, which facilitates information exchange among swarms and enhances exploration diversity. 2) social learning is introduced when updating the particles in each swarm, combined with individual learning to balance diversity and convergence.

In these environments, ETL pipelines must process large, distributed datasets while minimizing latency and transfer cost. Push down optimization, which executes transformation logic within database engines rather than within the ETL tool, has proven highly effective in single cloud systems. However, when applied across multiple clouds, it faces challenges related to data movement, heterogeneous SQL engines, orchestration complexity, and fragmented security controls. This paper examines the feasibility of push down optimization in multi cloud ETL pipelines and analyzes its benefits and limitations.

Whereas such conditions are natural in logical formalisms (such as relational calculus), SQL offers no direct “FOR ALL” quantifier nor a relational division operator. Thus, universal queries are typically expressed through nested negation, set difference, or aggregation, which can obscure intent and lead to varying performance across database systems. This thesis uses relational division as the algebraic foundation for representing universal quantification and looks into how the classical and extended forms can be implemented effectively in SQL. This study contrasts several relational division operators, such as standard division, generalized division, the small and great divide, and the grouped generalized division. A comparative framework is developed for these operators in respect of semantics, expressiveness, realizability, rewriteability, and computational complexity. These results indicate that the grouped generalized division operator is the most expressive and SQL-compatible manner of expressing restricted and grouped universal queries. This naturally matches up with newer features in SQL such as grouping and aggregation. It enables efficient evaluation strategies supported by contemporary query optimizers. This results in the finding that relational division remains a central concept in bridging logical expressiveness and practical query optimization in the relational model.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstreams/17119f3d-f634-4612-b7ef-eec95b859ba7/download&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=6583700010539202906&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jS3E50Hu9xUkfxmD6tgSyWU&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstreams/17119f3d-f634-4612-b7ef-eec95b859ba7/download&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=6583700010539202906&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jS3E50Hu9xUkfxmD6tgSyWU&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | D Tlekbay - 2025 - aaltodoc.aalto.fi", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/items/cedd5838-d4a3-4d8f-b374-85391be23726", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Traditional inventory systems often face limitations in handling unstructured data and providing timely decision support. To address these challenges, a modular framework incorporating NLP, machine learning, and a hybrid database architecture is proposed and evaluated. The system enables users to interact through natural language queries, which are translated into improved SQL commands using semantic parsing and Transformer models. Performance evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates significant improvements in query execution time, demand prediction accuracy, and inventory optimization. Comparative results indicate that the NLP-based system outperforms conventional systems in both cost-efficiency and responsiveness.

SQL is highly optimized for processing structured data laid out in relations. Meanwhile, in the present application development landscape, it is highly desirable to utilize the power of learned models to perform complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to understand and extract information from unstructured textual data. However, SQL as a query language and accompanying relational database systems are either incompatible or inefficient for workloads that require leveraging learned models. This results in complex engineering and multiple data migration operations that move data between the data sources and the model inference platform. In this paper, we present iPDB, a relational system that supports in-database machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) inferencing using extended SQL syntax. In iPDB, LLMs and ML calls can function as semantic projects, as predicates to perform semantic selects and semantic joins, or for semantic grouping in group-by clauses. iPDB has a novel relational predict operator and semantic query optimizations that enable users to write and efficiently execute semantic SQL queries, outperforming the state-of-the-art.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16432&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8841939764722241224&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jSt-8-f5X0PXqDpCgUknlg4&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16432&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8841939764722241224&ei=fot6adn5MvDB6rQPpbu0gQw&scisig=AHkA5jSt-8-f5X0PXqDpCgUknlg4&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | U Kumarasinghe, T Liu, C Liu, WG Aref - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.16432, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16432", "scholar_enhanced": true}
