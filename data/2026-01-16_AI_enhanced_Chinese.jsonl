STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multiverse is a novel software transactional memory (STM) system that integrates both versioned and unversioned transactions to deliver high performance for common workloads while efficiently supporting long-running reads through multiversioning.", "motivation": "Existing STMs struggle with long-running reads over frequently updated data; while multiversioning addresses this, it often degrades performance for transactions that don\u2019t require versioning.

It leverages multiversioning only when necessary (for long-running reads) while maintaining the performance of state-of-the-art unversioned STMs for typical workloads.", "result": "Experimental results show that Multiverse matches or exceeds the performance of existing STMs on standard workloads without long-running reads. For workloads involving long-running reads with frequent updates, Multiverse outperforms other STMs by orders of magnitude in throughput.", "conclusion": "Multiverse successfully bridges the gap between unversioned and multiversioned STMs, offering high performance across diverse workloads and significantly improving scalability for long-running read scenarios."}}

Many resources are created using vocabularies that are FAIR-compliant and well-annotated, yet the collective ecosystem of these resources often fails to interoperate effectively in practice. This continued challenge is mainly due to variation in identifier schemas and data models used in these resources. We have created two tools to bridge the chasm between interoperability in principle and interoperation in practice. Babel solves the problem of multiple identifier schemes by producing a curated set of identifier mappings to create cliques of equivalent identifiers that are exposed through high-performance APIs. ORION solves the problems of multiple data models by ingesting knowledge bases and transforming them into a common, community-managed data model.

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SDP is a novel algorithm for efficiently discovering the top-$k$ functional dependencies (FDs) in relational databases by ranking them based on redundancy count and employing pruning techniques with monotonic upper bounds, significantly outperforming exhaustive FD discovery methods in speed and memory usage.", "motivation": "Existing FD discovery algorithms suffer from prohibitive computational costs and produce excessively large result sets, making it difficult to identify useful dependencies in large-scale or high-dimensional data.", "method": "The authors propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count\u2014a measure of duplicated information linked to storage overhead and update anomalies.

We further present a static analysis tool to identify the merging opportunity without violating isolation as well as our experience of re-writing transactions in TPC-C and Spree, a popular real-world application.

While this innovation offers a rich choice of features and performance characteristics, it has simultaneously introduced a significant challenge: severe API fragmentation. Developers face a landscape of disparate, proprietary, and often volatile API contracts, which hinders application portability, increases maintenance overhead, and leads to vendor lock-in. This paper introduces Vextra, a novel middleware abstraction layer designed to address this fragmentation. Vextra presents a unified, high-level API for core database operations, including data upsertion, similarity search, and metadata filtering. It employs a pluggable adapter architecture to translate these unified API calls into the native protocols of various backend databases. We argue that such an abstraction layer is a critical step towards maturing the vector database ecosystem, fostering interoperability, and enabling higher-level query optimization, while imposing minimal performance overhead.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06727&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8980995946675536176&ei=57xoadTfKdvWieoPub_VeA&scisig=AHkA5jQ12Jic4IfoET_izminIYut&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06727&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8980995946675536176&ei=57xoadTfKdvWieoPub_VeA&scisig=AHkA5jQ12Jic4IfoET_izminIYut&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | C Suri, G Bhasin - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.06727, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06727", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "Vextra is a middleware abstraction layer that provides a unified API for vector databases, addressing API fragmentation and enabling portability and interoperability with minimal performance overhead.", "motivation": "The proliferation of specialized vector databases for AI applications like RAG has led to severe API fragmentation, causing vendor lock-in, reduced portability, and increased maintenance costs for developers.", "method": "Vextra implements a pluggable adapter architecture that translates a single, high-level unified API\u2014supporting upsertion, similarity search, and metadata filtering\u2014into the native protocols of various backend vector databases.", "result": "Vextra successfully abstracts away backend-specific APIs while maintaining minimal performance overhead, enabling application portability and laying the groundwork for advanced query optimization.", "conclusion": "A standardized middleware abstraction like Vextra is essential for the maturation of the vector database ecosystem, promoting interoperability, reducing vendor lock-in, and supporting future innovations in query processing."}}

{"id": "scholar_5c9d0fbde7d6ea067fed86a2804f8917", "title": "4 Biological Databases and Data Mining", "authors": ["Y Singh"], "summary": "The advancement in the field of technology significantly impacts the lives of individuals, primarily through business data processing and scientific computing. It opens the path for exponential growth in collecting data. The concept of data mining arises since traditional data mining systems fail to process large amounts of data. Data mining is the process called knowledge discovery from databases (KDD). Data mining has roots in databases, machine learning (ML), deep learning, and statistics and has contributions toward many other areas [1]. In this chapter, we explore the biological database, which is a repository used to store biological information. Biology and biological data are computed in the field of bioinformatics, an interdisciplinary science of analyzing biological data using information technology and computer science. The collection of data from the biological world is known as biological data, and the system that is used to store, search, and retrieve biological data is known as a biological database. Biological database design, development, and long-term management are core areas of the discipline of bioinformatics (http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Biological_database). It is the repository of biological information [2].\nA database is a platform where all the data is stored systematically and can be accessed and updated occasionally.

This study introduces a metaheuristic framework for optimized dimensionality reduction to identify the highly discriminative feature subsets. The proposed method (KDRPSO) combines a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with the K-Nearest Neighbors Distance Ratio (KDR) as a filterbased objective function. This metric quantitatively assesses class separability within a feature subspace by computing the ratio of the average distance from a sample to neighbors in other classes versus those in its own class. Maximizing this ratio with a penalty for model size, KDR-PSO automates the discovery of parsimonious feature sets that maximize inter-class discrimination. The method is computationally efficient, naturally lending itself to multi-class classification and avoiding the prohibitive cost associated with classifier-in-the-loop wrappers. Experimental results on benchmark gene expression and image datasets show that KDR-PSO can achieve better dimensionality reduction compared to baselines and other algorithms, such as winning a better or at least similar performing models with decreased features. This approach is a strong and pragmatic technique to improve the model interpretability and generalizability for high-dimensional regions.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx%3Fdirect%3Dtrue%26profile%3Dehost%26scope%3Dsite%26authtype%3Dcrawler%26jrnl%3D2158107X%26AN%3D190677590%26h%3Dyspkc9HmRoywiqfVngTQu0YzM4YRRiHraJlBzCY%252BC%252BPBJXVVpTkJ4tO0cbcCPDviGqcp%252BYY3QEWNOHlDIEmvfA%253D%253D%26crl%3Dc&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4450246633678404891&ei=57xoaY2BOr6Z6rQPnvC-6QQ&scisig=AHkA5jTUxZam-cNhHrSwHt-OIQDj&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx%3Fdirect%3Dtrue%26profile%3Dehost%26scope%3Dsite%26authtype%3Dcrawler%26jrnl%3D2158107X%26AN%3D190677590%26h%3Dyspkc9HmRoywiqfVngTQu0YzM4YRRiHraJlBzCY%252BC%252BPBJXVVpTkJ4tO0cbcCPDviGqcp%252BYY3QEWNOHlDIEmvfA%253D%253D%26crl%3Dc&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4450246633678404891&ei=57xoaY2BOr6Z6rQPnvC-6QQ&scisig=AHkA5jTUxZam-cNhHrSwHt-OIQDj&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=0&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | EA Ahmed, M Alzaqebah\u2026 - International Journal of \u2026, 2025 - search.ebscohost.com", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=2158107X&AN=190677590&h=yspkc9HmRoywiqfVngTQu0YzM4YRRiHraJlBzCY%2BC%2BPBJXVVpTkJ4tO0cbcCPDviGqcp%2BYY3QEWNOHlDIEmvfA%3D%3D&crl=c", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\uff08PSO\uff09\u4e0eK\u8fd1\u90bb\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\uff08KDR\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08KDR-PSO\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5927\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08PSO\uff09\u4e0eK\u8fd1\u90bb\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\uff08KDR\uff09\u6307\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002KDR\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6837\u672c\u5230\u5f02\u7c7b\u90bb\u5c45\u4e0e\u540c\u7c7b\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e4b\u6bd4\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u7cbe\u7b80\u800c\u9ad8\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKDR-PSO\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "KDR-PSO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous \"ragged filtration\" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) - a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent. The model demonstrates structural resilience across the 2010s \"CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) Winter\" and the post-2020 volatility regime shift, maintaining consistent performance through the pandemic, inflation shocks, and the subsequent higher-for-longer environment.

Focusing on Optimal Transport (OT), we introduce a novel notion of group fairness requiring that the probability of matching two individuals from any two given groups in the OT plan satisfies a predefined target. We first propose \\texttt{FairSinkhorn}, a modified Sinkhorn algorithm to compute perfectly fair transport plans efficiently. Since exact fairness can significantly degrade matching quality in practice, we then develop two relaxation strategies. The first one involves solving a penalised OT problem, for which we derive novel finite-sample complexity guarantees. This result is of independent interest as it can be generalized to arbitrary convex penalties. Our second strategy leverages bilevel optimization to learn a ground cost that induces a fair OT solution, and we establish a bound guaranteeing that the learned cost yields fair matchings on unseen data.

{"id": "scholar_85147b956c7f12e491fdee5ae73ad9d0", "title": "Optimal Learning Rate Schedule for Balancing Effort and Performance", "authors": ["V Njaradi", "R Carrasco"], "summary": "Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07830&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=12307612327796868984&ei=57xoaY2BOr6Z6rQPnvC-6QQ&scisig=AHkA5jQkAiefuNmn9aji0AsW9nUC&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=4&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07830&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=12307612327796868984&ei=57xoaY2BOr6Z6rQPnvC-6QQ&scisig=AHkA5jQkAiefuNmn9aji0AsW9nUC&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=4&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | V Njaradi, R Carrasco-Davis, PE Latham\u2026 - arXiv preprint arXiv \u2026, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07830", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u7387\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f53\u524d\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u672a\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4ed8\u51fa\u52aa\u529b\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6536\u76ca\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6240\u9700\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c4\u8303\u4e14\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u52aa\u529b\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

This paper develops a consolidated mathematical framework that unifies algorithmic optimization methods with system-level constraints to improve computational efficiency in such environments. The framework integrates convex optimization, stochastic gradient methods, distributed primal\u2013dual updates, and adaptive scheduling models, allowing each component of a data system memory, I/O, communication bandwidth, task queues, and compute throughput to be expressed as an optimization surface. By formalizing computation cost as a multivariate function of latency, bandwidth contention, node failures, and parallelization overhead, the framework enables analytical comparisons of algorithmic strategies under real system conditions. The study synthesizes existing optimization models and proposes a hybrid large-scale solver that combines coordinate descent, variance-reduced gradients, and asynchronous update rules to stabilize convergence even when data is partitioned unevenly or updates are delayed. The resulting formulation reduces communication rounds, improves throughput, and demonstrates strong resilience to straggler effects.

At the same time, the fastest-growing source of training data for frontier systems is synthetic (model-generated) data, which introduces feedback-loop risks such as distribution narrowing, memorization of artifacts, and\" model collapse\" effects under repeated self-training. Project STARSCREAM explores a complementary lever: pretraining and auxiliary self-supervision on large-scale, naturally occurring, non-anthropogenic observational streams from astronomy and astrophysics (for example, sky-survey imagery, time-domain light curves, spectroscopy, and event catalogs). This paper proposes a scientific program to test whether cosmic observational data can measurably improve robustness and adaptability of modern architectures (transformers, state-space and linear-attention sequence models, convolutional backbones, and multimodal encoders). We frame STARSCREAM as a methods hypothesis rather than a claim: that exposure to high-entropy, instrument-mediated signals and naturally structured noise can regularize representation learning, improve calibration, and increase out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on downstream tasks that involve temporal dynamics, perception, and control. We specify falsifiable hypotheses, define evaluation protocols, and detail a practical end-to-end system design spanning data acquisition (public archives, partnerships, hosted payloads, and custom small satellites), preprocessing and noise modeling, model integration, and cost and governance considerations. The intended outcome is a reproducible benchmark and an engineering blueprint that can be validated or rejected via controlled experiments. If supported, STARSCREAM would provide a new class of\" nature-sourced\" training signals that complements text, web, and simulation data, and reduces dependence on brittle synthetic pipelines.

Motivated by this, we undertake a systematic investigation on the complexity of sampling from the result of an acyclic join under equality conditions given only at runtime. When conditions are conjunctive, the goal is to understand when it is possible to precompute a feasible structure that uses O (IN) space and supports sampling in O (1) time, where IN is the input size. We present a dichotomy to characterize (subject to a widely-accepted conjecture) the existence of such structures based on the conditions supplied and, in every feasible scenario, give an optimal structure of O (IN) space and O (1) sample time. We then extend our investigation to conditions expressed in disjunctive normal form, where the core challenge reduces to the fundamental set union sampling problem. We overcome the challenge with an optimal algorithm and utilize it to develop optimal sampling structures. Our findings also lead to new results on the closely-related random enumeration problem.", "categories": ["Google Scholar"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/paper/icdt26.pdf&hl=en&sa=X&d=4831470035080384130&ei=62NpaYfqKtrJieoPjeLumAg&scisig=AHkA5jRGY0icDpoIemtIN9CdEiPp&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/paper/icdt26.pdf&hl=en&sa=X&d=4831470035080384130&ei=62NpaYfqKtrJieoPjeLumAg&scisig=AHkA5jRGY0icDpoIemtIN9CdEiPp&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | J Huang, Y Tao, S Wang - cse.cuhk.edu.hk", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/paper/icdt26.pdf", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7b49\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u73af\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5408\u53d6\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6790\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684O(IN)\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001O(1)\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u679a\u4e3e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5173\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e0d\u542b\u9009\u62e9\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7b49\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u65e0\u73af\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5408\u53d6\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5206\u5224\u5b9a\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728O(IN)\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001O(1)\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u6784\u9020\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6790\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u5f52\u7ea6\u4e3a\u96c6\u5408\u5e76\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a0\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u5bf9\u5408\u53d6\u6761\u4ef6\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5b58\u5728O(IN)\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001O(1)\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u6790\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u96c6\u5408\u5e76\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3\uff09\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u679a\u4e3e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e26\u7b49\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65e0\u73af\u8fde\u63a5\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u53d6\u548c\u6790\u53d6\u4e24\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u968f\u673a\u679a\u4e3e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While effective in practice, their theoretical limitations are not fully understood. We present a general framework for proving lower bounds on query time for learned indexes, expressed in terms of their space overhead and parameterized by the model class used for approximation. Our formulation captures a broad family of learned indexes, including most existing designs, as piecewise model-based predictors. We solve the problem of lower bounding query time in two steps: first, we use probabilistic tools to control the effect of sampling when the database attribute is drawn from a probability distribution. Then, we analyze the approximation-theoretic problem of how to optimally represent a cumulative distribution function with approximators from a given model class. Within this framework, we derive lower bounds under a range of modeling and distributional assumptions, paying particular attention to the case of piecewise linear and piecewise constant model classes, which are common in practical implementations. Our analysis shows how tools from approximation theory, such as quantization and Kolmogorov widths, can be leveraged to formalize the space-time tradeoffs inherent to learned index structures. The resulting bounds illuminate core limitations of these methods.", "categories": ["Google Scholar"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06629&hl=en&sa=X&d=5601705435374249079&ei=62NpaYfqKtrJieoPjeLumAg&scisig=AHkA5jTZGx1GkeGOJ8OP_R5Q8rWG&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06629&hl=en&sa=X&d=5601705435374249079&ei=62NpaYfqKtrJieoPjeLumAg&scisig=AHkA5jTZGx1GkeGOJ8OP_R5Q8rWG&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | LA Croquevielle, R Sokolovskii, T Heinis - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.06629, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06629", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc1\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u4e0b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982\u91cf\u5316\u548cKolmogorov\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff09\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u5de5\u5177\u63a7\u5236\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5206\u6790\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u5730\u903c\u8fd1\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u903c\u8fd1\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u523b\u753b\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u5b58\u5728\u7531\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u903c\u8fd1\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u683c\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We provide an implementation covering a wide range of queries and orders; it allows us to investigate intriguing practical aspects, including the comparative performance of database systems and the relationship between direct access and its single-access counterpart.", "categories": ["Google Scholar"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06013&hl=en&sa=X&d=15361939681310771091&ei=62NpaYfqKtrJieoPjeLumAg&scisig=AHkA5jQxfzkEdYAo67lZ3g03S3Ix&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=2&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06013&hl=en&sa=X&d=15361939681310771091&ei=62NpaYfqKtrJieoPjeLumAg&scisig=AHkA5jQxfzkEdYAo67lZ3g03S3Ix&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=2&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | J Hu, N Tziavelis - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.06013, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06013", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u5176\u5355\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d8\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u652f\u6301\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\uff08\u5373\u6839\u636e\u6392\u540d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u6709\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u6392\u5e8f\u5df2\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u5374\u9c9c\u6709\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u501f\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u5355\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u5176\u5355\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7406\u8bba\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
