### [1] [Optimus: Deployable Query Optimization via Novel SQL Rewrites](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://openreview.net/pdf%3Fid%3DZVzYv7Qois&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8376193066075901600&ei=nwRxaby5HPStieoP-8T7kA0&scisig=AHkA5jS9_FfixoqCddZw8Pcingt6&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel)

TL;DR: Optimus improves query optimization by expanding the action space with novel execution plan rewrites, achieving a 1.16x speedup over PostgreSQL on the JOB benchmark without engine modifications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learned query optimizers are limited to predefined configuration sets, restricting the potential of plan space exploration; Optimus addresses this by dynamically discovering and applying new rewrites.

Method: Optimus mines novel execution plan rewrites and selects among them online using graph-based inductive matrix completion and a multilayer perceptron, aiming to minimize query latency while ensuring deployability through guard-checked compilation and no engine changes.

Result: On the extended JOB benchmark, Optimus achieves a 1.16x speedup compared to vanilla PostgreSQL using only its newly discovered rewrites.

Conclusion: By expanding the optimizer’s action space with learnable, safe, and deployable rewrites, Optimus demonstrates that performance gains are achievable without modifying the underlying database engine.

Abstract: Learned database query optimizers typically optimize over a set of configurations, which limits the attainable plan space. Optimus expands the action space itself by mining novel execution plan rewrites and learns to select among these actions online. Optimus utilizes graph-based inductive matrix completion and a multilayer perceptron with the objective of minimizing latency. Crucially, the system is deployable by design: it requires no engine modifications and its rules include guard-checked compilation. On the extended JOB benchmark, Optimus yields a speedup of 1.16x over vanilla PostgreSQL solely using novel rewrites.

TL;DR: 传统基于关键词的搜索引擎在语义网环境下已不适用，需采用基于语义的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语义网框架下，传统关键词搜索无法满足用户对语义理解的需求。

Method: 提出基于用户关键词语义的新搜索方法。

Result: 暂未提供具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 需发展语义驱动的搜索技术以适应语义网的发展。

Abstract: Abstract Within the emergent Semantic Web framework, the use of traditional web search engines based on keywords provided by the users is not adequate anymore. Instead, new methods based on the semantics of user keywords must be defined to …

### [3] [Trajectory-Driven Multi-Product Influence Maximization in Billboard Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14737)
*Dildar Ali,Suman Banerjee,Rajibul Islam*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 该论文研究了面向多产品的广告牌广告投放问题，提出两种变体：共享广告位与互斥广告位，并分别建模为多子模覆盖及其推广问题，设计了基于连续贪心和随机舍入的双准则近似算法以及基于采样的对偶贪心算法，实验验证了方法的有效性与效率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告牌广告选择通常针对单一产品，而现实中广告商常需同时推广多个产品，且每种产品有特定的影响力需求。如何在有限广告位下满足所有产品的影响力需求，成为亟待解决的优化问题。

Method: 针对共享广告位情形，将问题建模为多子模覆盖问题，采用连续贪心框架结合随机舍入设计双准则近似算法；针对互斥广告位情形，提出一种采样驱动的近似方法，并结合高效的原始-对偶贪心算法以自然保证广告位集合的不相交性。

Result: 在真实轨迹与广告牌数据集上的大量实验表明，所提出的两种算法在满足多产品影响力需求的同时，具有良好的运行效率和解质量。

Conclusion: 该工作首次系统地研究了多产品广告牌广告投放中的影响力覆盖问题，通过理论建模与高效算法设计，为实际商业场景中的多目标户外广告优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Billboard Advertising has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertising technique, where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play advertisement content there, with the hope that it will be observed by many people and, effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i \neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.
