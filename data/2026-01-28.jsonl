This paper presents a case study of integrating three major public chemical repositories: PubChem (176 million compounds), ChEMBL, and eMolecules, to construct a curated dataset for molecular property prediction. We investigate whether byte-offset indexing can practically overcome brute-force scalability limits while preserving data integrity at hundred-million scale. Our results document the progression from an intractable brute-force search algorithm with projected 100-day runtime to a byte-offset indexing architecture achieving 3.2-hour completion-a 740-fold performance improvement through algorithmic complexity reduction from O(NxM) to O(N+M). Systematic validation of 176 million database entries revealed hash collisions in InChIKey molecular identifiers, necessitating pipeline reconstruction using collision-free full InChI strings. We present performance benchmarks, quantify trade-offs between storage overhead and scientific rigor, and compare our approach with alternative large-scale integration strategies. The resulting system successfully extracted 435,413 validated compounds and demonstrates generalizable principles for large-scale scientific data integration where uniqueness constraints exceed hash-based identifier capabilities."}

Despite their growing adoption in both industry and academia, there is a lack of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the performance of data lake systems. Existing benchmarks primarily target traditional data warehouses and focus on structured SQL workloads, making them insufficient for capturing the diverse workloads and access patterns typical of data lakes.\n  In this work, we propose a new benchmarking framework for data lakes that aims to provide an objective and comparative evaluation of different data lake implementations. Our benchmark covers multiple data types and workload models, including data retrieval, aggregation, querying, and similarity search, which is a common yet underexplored operation in existing benchmarks. We measure key performance metrics such as query execution time, metadata generation time, and metadata size across different scale factors. The benchmark is designed to be extensible and reproducible, enabling users to generate datasets and evaluate data lake systems under realistic and diverse scenarios. We conduct our experiments on CloudLab and demonstrate how the proposed benchmark can be used to compare both commercial and open-source data lake platforms."}

Density-based methods address this ambiguity by favoring repairs that preserve dense, high-quality data regions; however, their effectiveness is limited by density bias from dirty clusters, high computational cost, and uniform attribute weighting. We propose a topology-aware approximate subset repair framework based on a joint density-conflict penalty model. The framework integrates three key components. First, a two-layer conflict detection strategy combines attribute inverted indexes with CFD rule grouping to efficiently identify violations. Second, we introduce EntroCFDensity, a density metric that incorporates information entropy and CFD weights to dynamically adjust attribute importance and reduce homogeneity bias. Third, a conflict degree measure is defined to complement local density, enabling a topology-adaptive penalty mechanism with dynamic weight allocation guided by the coefficient of variation. The conflict graph is further decomposed into independent subgraphs, transforming global repair into tractable local subproblems. Based on this framework, we develop two algorithms: PPIS, a scalable heuristic, and MICO, a mixed-integer programming method with theoretical guarantees. Experimental results show that our approach improves repair accuracy and robustness while effectively preserving high-quality data."}

As the scale of domain-specific repositories expands, conventional RAG methods increasingly face challenges in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, which in turn constrain overall system performance. To address these limitations, this study incorporates a query enhancement and dual-path optimization framework, integrating query generalization and query decomposition mechanisms to systematically improve the interpretability and quality of the question-answering process. In the retrieval phase, a hybrid retrieval strategy is employed by combining sparse and dense retrieval paradigms. Within the dense retrieval component, Matryoshka representation learning and self-attention enhancement are introduced to extend the conventional encoder architecture, thereby improving the model’s adaptability and semantic representation capacity. Experimental evaluations were conducted using DeepSeek-V3-Chat as the baseline model on the UltraDomain QA dataset, covering two vertical domains—science and healthcare. The proposed framework achieved an average improvement of 3 percentage points in F1-score and approximately 10 percentage points in answer relevance, while maintaining consistent factual faithfulness.

However, these systems encounter a major bottleneck in query performance, mainly attributed to the prolonged access latency of cloud storage and metadata redundancy of large number of timeseries. Thus, it is critical to optimize query performance within cloud environment and reduce metadata redundancy.\nIn this paper, we propose CloudTS, which is a novel timeseries data storage model with query optimization for cloud storage. CloudTS separately manages metadata and data, and introduces an efficient global metadata management for both space saving and query speedup. CloudTS also transparently supports the time-partitioned tag-based query model in performance monitoring timeseries systems. For metadata, a global tag dictionary is built to reduce metadata redundancy and a novel timeseries-tag mapping technique with a twodimension bitmap is designed so the mapping of timeseries and tags can be efficiently accomplished to support tag-based queries. For data, the compressed data chunks are put into objects by timeseries group. We have implemented a fully functional prototype of CloudTS and evaluated it with production timeseries data and synthetic workloads based on Amazon S3. In comparison, Cortex, a cloud-based timeseries system widely adopted by industries, and Apache Parquet and JSON Time Series, two representative cloud storage formats, are utilized in the evaluation.

A single database system therefore fails to deliver the necessary balance of latency, scalability, and resiliency expected by contemporary workloads. One effective solution is polyglot service persistence, an approach where multiple database engines coexist within the same system to leverage the individual strengths of each. In this paper, we introduce the development of a hybrid platform that unifies several database types—together with a distributed file store—through a micro-services architecture. This strategy yields an adaptable, horizontally scalable solution capable of satisfying heterogeneous data requirements while simplifying operational overhead. Our methodology centres on a framework that exposes a unified interface to all underlying datastores, so end users can manage relational, document, and file-based data without installing or configuring each engine individually; connection logic, driver management, and schema coordination are fully abstracted. In addition, it synthesises fully documented REST APIs for every generated schema, enabling seamless CRUD operations across all underlying stores. The hybrid system is engineered to optimise every database model’s forte: transactional consistency in relational stores, elastic growth for schema-less datasets in document stores, and built-in redundancy plus fault tolerance for large files in distributed storage.

First, based on the data of Chinese A-share listed companies, a panel fixed effect model is constructed, and the XGBoost framework is introduced to identify the causal effect of ESG on financing costs, and the confounding variable bias is controlled by the Backdoor Adjustment formula. Secondly, this paper uses Bootstrap resampling for robustness testing, and combines Granger causal analysis to reveal the timeliness and dynamic characteristics of ESG impact. On this basis, the XGBoost algorithm is introduced to rank and analyze the determinants of financing costs, and further verify the importance of each sub-dimension of ESG. At the data level, ESG data comes from mainstream rating agencies such as MSCI, Refinitiv and Bloomberg, and is standardized and winsorized by -score.

To speed up the inference, deep learning compilers search for high-performance schedules for the DNN tensor programs. During the process, cost models have been extensively studied to evaluate the performance of the schedules, such that high-performance ones can be efficiently obtained. However, existing methods suffer from either high overhead or low accuracy of performance evaluation, both of which limit the efficiency of the final schedule. To address these issues, we propose FASP, a fast and accurate framework for schedule performance evaluation, based on Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). First, we propose a redundancy-aware ASTs reduction method to generate compact ASTs for more accurate feature extraction. Second, we propose a feature extraction method based on compact ASTs, which extracts features by accounting for computation nodes, loop nodes, and their structural relationships. Third, we propose a composition-similarity-driven ASTs classification method and a class-specific cost model architecture for more accurate performance evaluation. FASP overcomes the limitations of prior methods by significantly reducing evaluation errors. Experiments show its excellent performance in both single-model and cross-model evaluation, with errors ranging from 6 % to .

However, previous software projects' effort estimation methods, such as source lines of code and function point size metrics, have limitations in estimating effort at the specification stage. A machine learning-based object point analysis technique for software effort estimation is the earliest technique to predict software project effort at the specification stage. Even object point analysis software and effort estimation techniques using machine learning algorithms can make effort predictions at an earlier stage. Still, they have some accuracy limitations compared to the actual effort. However, deep learning models showed better accuracy in effort estimation near the actual effort at the earliest specification stage. This work advances the state-of-the-art by combining OPA’s simplicity with DNN’s predictive power, offering a practical solution for industry adoption. The study conducted a comparative experimental study on object point effort estimation using a recent deep learning model and three traditional machine learning algorithms (K-Neighbors Regression, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Regression).

To address high-dimensional design spaces, conflicting objectives, and costly finite element model (FEM) evaluations, a hierarchical surrogate-assisted strategy is developed. Design variables are decomposed into two levels using Morris sensitivity analysis and crossed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). A deep neural network (DNN) surrogate enhanced by transfer learning (TL) is employed to improve prediction accuracy with limited data, while an improved multiobjective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) is used to search for nondominated solutions with enhanced convergence. K-medoids clustering and a hybrid weighting scheme are further applied for solution filtering and selection. The framework is validated on a parameterized STAF-PMSM, achieving a 53.4% increase in torque and a 65.3% reduction in torque ripple, with only moderate increases in loss and cost. Meanwhile, the number of FEM evaluations is reduced from 2600 to 920, confirming the computational efficiency of the method.

These low-altitude operational scenarios require precise and efficient UAV swarm coordination, making autonomous flight control a key challenge. In this work, we investigate a distributed UAV swarm flight control problem in which each UAV autonomously makes decisions based on partial observations of neighboring UAVs and the surrounding environment. This problem involves multi-objective optimization, as the goal is to simultaneously minimize the cost of UAV control and maximize the speed of UAV service activation. To address the inefficiency of traditional reinforcement learning for this multi-objective problem when confronted with fluctuating low-altitude environmental conditions, we propose a distributed autonomous control method based on evolutionary multi-agent multi-objective reinforcement learning (EMAMORL). This approach integrates distributed intelligence with multi-objective reinforcement learning to generate numerous policies for distinct preferences for different objectives in a single iteration while reducing communication and control overheads. During the online inference phase, agents use these trained policies for real-time decision-making.

The model is evaluated using Dice coefficient, F1 score, IoU and overall accuracy, along with computational complexity measured by parameter count and GFLOPs. Results indicate that backbone-enhanced models outperform base configurations by providing deeper and more robust feature representations.

While early models relied on dense operations, techniques like pruning have introduced sparsity, leading to a mix of dense and sparse operator types. Most existing accelerators are specialized for specific operators and perform poorly in mixed scenarios, while those supporting multiple operators often lack flexibility and suffer from suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose VersaAccel, a configurable accelerator for sparse and dense matrix operators. It supports four distinct configurations, each optimized for a set of operators. A key feature of our design is its adaptive configuration selection mechanism, driven by a lightweight cost model that explicitly evaluates the performance-energy trade-off between available options. This allows VersaAccel to dynamically choose the most efficient configuration—opting for higher performance when the gain outweighs the energy cost, or prioritizing energy efficiency when appropriate. Experimental results demonstrate that VersaAccel achieves an average performance/area improvement of 3.10× across multiple operators (MV, MM, SPMV, SpMM, SpMSpM) and 4.06× on full model evaluations (ResNet18, VGG16, LLaMA2-7B, BERT-Base), compared to mainstream accelerators.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11272451/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=3998206704442045118&ei=cKB3aerIB4eUywS5-prpDw&scisig=AHkA5jTfgip8nxuH6JMETrcS8PsC&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=9&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11272451/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=3998206704442045118&ei=cKB3aerIB4eUywS5-prpDw&scisig=AHkA5jTfgip8nxuH6JMETrcS8PsC&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=9&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | M Tang, M Wen - … Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of …, 2025 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11272451/", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.
