The domains of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics have also undergone a similar phenomenon through the advent of large foundational models in the form of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Vision Language Action models (VLAs), respectively. In this paper, we investigate the current state of Artificial Intelligence for Database Systems research (AI4DB), and assess how far AI4DB systems are from achieving their own Move\\,37 moment. We envision a Generative Database Agent (Gen-DBA, for short) as the pathway to achieving Move\\,37 for database systems that will bring generative reasoning and creativity into the realm of database learning tasks. This vision paper explores this direction by presenting the recipe for building Gen-DBA that encompasses but is not limited to a Transformer backbone, a hardware-grounded tokenization mechanism, a two-stage Goal-Directed Next Token Prediction training paradigm, and a generative inference process."}

SQL is highly optimized for processing structured data laid out in relations. Meanwhile, in the present application development landscape, it is highly desirable to utilize the power of learned models to perform complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to understand and extract information from unstructured textual data. However, SQL as a query language and accompanying relational database systems are either incompatible or inefficient for workloads that require leveraging learned models. This results in complex engineering and multiple data migration operations that move data between the data sources and the model inference platform. In this paper, we present iPDB, a relational system that supports in-database machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) inferencing using extended SQL syntax. In iPDB, LLMs and ML calls can function as semantic projects, as predicates to perform semantic selects and semantic joins, or for semantic grouping in group-by clauses. iPDB has a novel relational predict operator and semantic query optimizations that enable users to write and efficiently execute semantic SQL queries, outperforming the state-of-the-art."}

This study proposes a four-stage transaction management framework for document-oriented NoSQL databases, with MongoDB as the reference platform. The framework combines transaction lifecycle management, operation classification, pre-execution conflict detection, and an adaptive locking strategy with timeout-based deadlock prevention. Formal correctness analysis shows that the proposed approach guarantees conflict serializability under defined conditions. An experimental evaluation using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) workloads A, B, and F, with concurrency levels ranging from 1 to 100 clients, demonstrates a reduction in transaction abort rates from 8.3% to 4.7%, the elimination of observed deadlocks, and a 34.2% decrease in latency variance. Throughput improvements ranging from 6.3% to 18.4% are observed under high concurrency, particularly for read-modify-write workloads. Distributed experiments on clusters of up to 9 nodes confirm scalability, achieving 15.2% higher throughput and 53% lower abort rates than baseline systems. Comparisons with MongoDB's native transactions, CockroachDB, and TiDB indicate that the proposed framework strikes a good balance between consistency guarantees and performance overhead. Sensitivity analysis identifies optimal parameter settings, including a lock timeout of 100 ms, an initial backoff of 10 ms, and a maximum backoff of 500 ms. These results show that carefully designed consistency mechanisms can significantly improve data integrity in NoSQL systems without undermining scalability."}

Despite three decades of standardization efforts, over 40 metadata schemas now span the building lifecycle, with fragmentation accelerating rather than resolving. Current approaches rely on point-to-point mappings that scale quadratically with the number of schemas, or universal ontologies that become unwieldy monoliths. The fundamental gap is the absence of mathematical foundations for structure-preserving transformations across heterogeneous building data. Here we show that category theory provides these foundations, enabling systematic data integration with $O(n)$ specification complexity for $n$ ontologies. We formalize building ontologies as first-order theories and demonstrate two proof-of-concept implementations in Categorical Query Language (CQL): 1) generating BRICK models from IFC design data at commissioning, and 2) three-way integration of IFC, BRICK, and RealEstateCore where only two explicit mappings yield the third automatically through categorical composition. Our correct-by-construction approach treats property sets as first-class schema entities and provides automated bidirectional migrations, and enables cross-ontology queries. These results establish feasibility of categorical methods for building data integration and suggest a path toward an app ecosystem for buildings, where mathematical foundations enable reliable component integration analogous to smartphone platforms."}

In parallel, submodular and combinatorial information measures (SIMs) have recently been proposed as a principled framework for extending entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information to general submodular functions, and have been used extensively in data subset selection, active learning, domain adaptation, and representation learning. This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications.", "categories": ["Google Scholar"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12724&hl=en&sa=X&d=2298347721120755187&ei=fkp1ac2bCLuM6rQP2dOq-Ag&scisig=AHkA5jTYHfVedb5vgco4-iTNwb7D&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12724&hl=en&sa=X&d=2298347721120755187&ei=fkp1ac2bCLuM6rQP2dOq-Ag&scisig=AHkA5jTYHfVedb5vgco4-iTNwb7D&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | R Iyer - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.12724, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12724", "scholar_enhanced": true}

As data volumes grow and workloads become more complex, these problems have become exponentially harder to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, especially quantum annealing, is a promising paradigm that can efficiently explore very large search spaces through quantum tunneling. It can escape local optima by tunneling through energy barriers rather than climbing over them. Earlier works mainly focused on providing an abstract representation (e.g., Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)) for the database optimization problems (e.g., join order) and overlooked the real integration within database systems due to the high overhead of quantum computing services (e.g., a minimum 5s runtime for D-Wave's CQM-Solver). Recently, quantum annealing providers have offered more low-latency solutions, e.g., NL-Solver, which paves the road to actually realizing quantum solutions within DBMSs. However, this raises new systems research challenges in balancing efficiency and solution quality. In this talk, we show that this balance is possible to achieve. As a proof of concept, we present Q2O, the first real Quantum-augmented Query Optimizer. We show the end-to-end workflow: we encode the join order problem as a nonlinear model, a format solvable by the NL-Solver, using actual database statistics; the solution is translated into a plan hint that guides PostgreSQL's optimizer to produce a complete plan.

Existing methods mainly targeted B-tree-based systems, where costs and cardinality are highly correlated. However, LSM-Trees, due to their unique storage structure, violate the assumptions of existing learning methods, causing cardinality to be irrelevant to cost estimation. In addition, the constantly changing data layout leads to severe data drifts when updating data, preventing current learning-based models from accurately estimating costs in an agile way. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer end-to-end cost estimation model for LSM-Tree-based database systems. This model treats cost estimation as a regression problem and comprises two layers: the storage layer and the query plan layer. The storage layer employs lightweight neural networks to leverage data distribution, provide information to the query plan layer, and address the challenges posed by data drift in LSM-Trees. The query plan layer uses the Transformer framework and incorporates structural information to learn the representation of plans. This dual-layer architecture allows our model to effectively embed storage information and query plan tree details. The results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art cost estimation accuracy for database systems based on LSM-Trees.

With the shift toward cloud-native RAN and CI/CD pipelines enhancing RAN operations (RANOps), this evolution is set to continue. These advances offer greater flexibility, enabling improved radio resource management (RRM) and higher quality of service (QoS), but introduce added complexity and operational expenditure (OPEX). Taming this complexity is a key focus in 6G research. Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and automation (e.g., Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)) are central to managing RRM complexity. However, ML and AI require significant energy due to domain- and task-specific training, driven by diverse services, deployments, devices, and dynamic wireless conditions. Traditional ML requires retraining for each change, limiting reuse and increasing overhead. Transfer Learning (TL) addresses these challenges by enabling knowledge transfer across related tasks. This article explores deep TL techniques for RRM in RAN. We present a case study deploying a TL-based xApp in Open RAN to predict future serving cells for conventional user equipment (UE).

To address this, we propose UniSparTa, a unified sparse tensor program tuning framework that automatically generates high-performance programs. First, we extract unified optimization principles for high-performance sparse tensor programs and propose a domain-specific language (DSL) to automatically generate a high-quality design space without manual intervention. Second, by analyzing the general distribution of the design space, we introduce an adaptive search strategy combining Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Simulated Annealing (SA).

BFI’s clear-text transmission and stable characteristics make it an ideal choice for localization tasks. We prove that BFI provides a lightweight alternative to CSI, significantly reducing both data acquisition and storage requirements. Compared with traditional deep learning frameworks using convolutional networks, DBLoc employs a pruning-based residual architecture to reduce computational overhead, achieving an inference cost of only 175.7 MFLOPs, thus optimizing performance within an edge-deployment budget. To enable transferability that surpasses current meta-learning approaches, DBLoc incorporates a virtual-domain-based meta-learning algorithm, ensuring robust performance with minimal target-domain data.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a multiagent federated reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm aimed at optimizing the deployment and resource allocation of multi-UAV to enhance network utility. The approach employs personalized proximal federated learning, allowing each agent to learn and train independently based on local observations, while periodically uploading model parameters to a central server. The central server maintains a global model and returns updated parameters with proximal terms, thereby improving cooperation among agents while reducing communication overhead. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates a reward network competition mechanism locally to provide effective target values for model training.

Scenario–dependent current profiles are derived from a zonal dataset with four representative operating conditions; distances and topology are held fixed, and only wire types are optimized. A multi–head Deep Q–Network (DQN) selects a gauge per centroid using a reward that balances mass reduction, constraint compliance, and voltage–budget utilization. Validation with MATLAB scripts and a companion Simulink model shows near–identical voltage drops, margins, and validity flags across 65°C, 85°C, and 105°C. On a 12–zone High–application case at 85°C, the RL policy achieves 100% compliance with an average voltage drop of 0.30V, whereas baselines (a static–gauge design from Hossain et al. and a rule–based scenario–aware method) exhibit higher drops and lower compliance. System–level comparisons with Hossain et al. (distances unchanged) indicate total harness mass reductions of –3.62% (Low), –32.01% (Mid), and –34.51% (High). For the 12–zone High case, the RL design reduces centroid→battery mass by 12.52 kg, yielding about €108.13 copper cost savings (priced at € 8.6338/kg) and 51.95 kg CO2e lower embodied emissions per harness. Results demonstrate that scenario–aware RL provides a practical, scalable path to lighter, standard–compliant harnesses that remain robust across temperatures and load variability.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/6287639/6514899/11328036.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=5151860831680064988&ei=w5V1aeGVPKOi6rQPoMCXoAE&scisig=AHkA5jRcgFB-UvY_YIYGGQvLhLSV&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=9&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/6287639/6514899/11328036.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=5151860831680064988&ei=w5V1aeGVPKOi6rQPoMCXoAE&scisig=AHkA5jRcgFB-UvY_YIYGGQvLhLSV&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=9&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | MS Hossain, A Jesser - IEEE Access, 2026 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11328036/", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Concretely, we re-write transactions to 1) merge similar statements using specific SQL semantics; 2) eliminate redundant reads; and 3) merge contending statements across transactions by pre-computing their aggregated effect. Following this idea, we present the design of TransactionMerger, a middleware to collect and merge transactions across different clients. We further present a static analysis tool to identify the merging opportunity without violating isolation as well as our experience of re-writing transactions in TPC-C and Spree, a popular real-world application. Our evaluation shows that such transaction merging can improve TPC-C throughput by up to 2.65X and Spree throughput by 3.52X.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10596&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=18293936042235188727&ei=y4t2abaEPd_YieoP1b6liQE&scisig=AHkA5jTGI98Q1lCqUsxFiAPn79AS&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10596&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=18293936042235188727&ei=y4t2abaEPd_YieoP1b6liQE&scisig=AHkA5jTGI98Q1lCqUsxFiAPn79AS&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | X Ren, F Li, Y Wang - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.10596, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10596", "scholar_enhanced": true}

However, due to privacy concerns, data encryption prior to outsourcing is an important means of protection, which in turn requires performing queries over the encrypted data. While several approaches do offer support for privacy preserving skyline or top-k queries, they typically struggle with efficiency when extended to secure top-k dominating queries, due to the inherent nature of combining the advantages of both top k and skyline queries. Nevertheless, this nature renders them as a more practical and promising alternative for location-based services. To address this, we introduce STLD, a secure top-k location-based dominating query scheme. Specifically, we develop an innovative index structure called Secure Aggregate R-tree (SAR-tree) by utilizing the Paillier cryptosystem and introducing meticulously crafted noise, while also incorporating principles from aggregate R-trees and semi-blind R-trees. Leveraging this structure, we propose a series of secure sub-protocols to facilitate top-k dominating queries, accompanied by optimization techniques to mitigate latency associated with computationally intensive dominating operations. Given an encrypted query, STLD not only efficiently answers the query but also guarantees the privacy of data(sets), results, queries and access patterns. Finally, STLD undergoes rigorous theoretical security and complexity analysis, complemented by empirical evaluations that demonstrate its performance and feasibility, achieving a reduction in query cost by 40%-60% compared to multiple competing methods.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11347495/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13932546995748641347&ei=y4t2abaEPd_YieoP1b6liQE&scisig=AHkA5jRPXi6O8uZVssFfBgY_EwZx&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11347495/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13932546995748641347&ei=y4t2abaEPd_YieoP1b6liQE&scisig=AHkA5jRPXi6O8uZVssFfBgY_EwZx&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Z Wang, X Ding, W Song, P Zhou… - … on Dependable and …, 2026 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11347495/", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Yet, these systems struggle to scale in realistic enterprise settings with large, complex schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and expensive multi-step reasoning. Emerging agentic approaches show potential for adaptive reasoning but often suffer from inefficiency and instability-repeating interactions with databases, producing inconsistent outputs, and occasionally failing to generate valid answers. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark. It also improves execution accuracy, reaching a state-of-the-art accuracy of 44.8% on the Spider 2.0 Lite benchmark.", "categories": ["Tim Kraska"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15709&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=16531436145383766528&ei=zIt2aeaVC7uM6rQP2dOq-Ag&scisig=AHkA5jSS9V1XR4QEP4zzpfyHpsSG&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:12547990050236097089:AHkA5jS71WnAM-NbtRFODodSIWPy&html=&pos=0&folt=art", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15709&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=16531436145383766528&ei=zIt2aeaVC7uM6rQP2dOq-Ag&scisig=AHkA5jSS9V1XR4QEP4zzpfyHpsSG&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:12547990050236097089:AHkA5jS71WnAM-NbtRFODodSIWPy&html=&pos=0&folt=art", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | A Biswal, C Lei, X Qin, A Li, B Narayanaswamy… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15709", "scholar_enhanced": true}
