Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language. NL4ST features a three-layer architecture: (i) knowledge base and corpus for knowledge preparation, (ii) natural language understanding for entity linking, and (iii) generating physical plans. Our demonstration will showcase how NL4ST provides effective spatio-temporal physical plans, verified by using four real and synthetic datasets. We make NL4ST online and provide the demo video at https://youtu.be/-J1R7R5WoqQ."}

Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.

While static algorithms are inefficient due to full re-execution, incremental algorithms suffer from severe performance and memory bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EAIFD, a novel algorithm for incremental FD discovery. EAIFD maintains the partial hypergraph of difference sets and reframes the incremental FD discovery problem into minimal hitting set enumeration on hypergraph, avoiding full re-runs. EAIFD introduces two key innovations. First, a multi-attribute hash table ($MHT$) is devised for high-frequency key-value mappings of valid FDs, whose memory consumption is proven to be independent of the dataset size. Second, two-step validation strategy is developed to efficiently validate the enumerated candidates, which leverages $MHT$ to effectively reduce the validation space and then selectively loads data blocks for batch validation of remaining candidates, effectively avoiding repeated I/O operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of EAIFD. Compared to existing algorithms, EAIFD achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in runtime while reducing memory usage by over two orders-of-magnitude, establishing it as a highly efficient and scalable solution for incremental FD discovery."}

Traditional data structures, such as B-trees and hash tables, often prioritize either memory usage or query speed, leading to suboptimal performance in memory-constrained systems. This paper proposes a hybrid data structure that combines the strengths of multiple traditional data structures to optimize both memory usage and query processing speed. The proposed hybrid structure integrates cache-conscious algorithms, dynamic memory allocation, and compression techniques for intermediate query results. The approach is evaluated through extensive benchmarking tests comparing it to standard data structures like B-trees and hash tables under various workloads. Results show that the hybrid data structure reduces memory overhead by up to 30% while maintaining query processing speeds up to 1.5 times faster than conventional methods. Furthermore, the hybrid structure demonstrates robust performance across different types of queries, including both point and range queries, ensuring versatility and efficiency. The findings indicate that this hybrid approach provides a promising solution for HPC systems, where both memory efficiency and query speed are essential.

However, the long-term effects of LLM-generated texts on retrieval systems remain underexplored, creating challenges for mitigating their impact. The effects are examined in this study, with a particular focus on the “Spiral of Silence” phenomenon, which refers to the marginalization of diverse information as certain types of content dominate, leading to a homogenized information ecosystem. To investigate this, a simulation pipeline is constructed to model the iterative introduction of LLM-generated texts into retrieval systems. Experimental results across multiple iterations reveal that as the presence of LLM-generated texts within the system grows, retrieval systems exhibit a stronger tendency to retrieve these texts. This trend, in turn, reduces the visibility of human-generated content, diminishes diversity, propagates errors, and results in a notable decline in retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Utility-Driven Multi-Objective Optimization (UMO) framework to effectively mitigate the “Spiral of Silence”. This framework employs a two-phase approach: an optimization phase, leveraging the NSGA-II algorithm to derive optimal preference weights for multiple objectives, and a memorization phase, which directly integrates these weights into the retrieval vector space without requiring additional model retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework maintains stable retrieval effectiveness, improves the retrieval proportion of human-generated content, reduces the excessive influence of LLM-generated texts, and preserves information diversity, effectively mitigating the “Spiral of Silence”.", "categories": ["\"query optimization\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3788865&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8931733612144997941&ei=JrFxabWCJ7uM6rQP2dOq-Ag&scisig=AHkA5jTXJkiRGy0IV0VKX7_1TVKI&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3788865&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8931733612144997941&ei=JrFxabWCJ7uM6rQP2dOq-Ag&scisig=AHkA5jTXJkiRGy0IV0VKX7_1TVKI&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:10189913451943534390:AHkA5jTEDuZMpn0kzIrVKhRpZyjA&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | X Chen, B He, H Lin, X Han, T Wang, B Cao… - ACM Transactions on …, 2026 - dl.acm.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3788865", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Ciphertext policy attribute‐based encryption (CP‐ABE) is a widely recognized solution for secure access control in outsourced data environments. However, existing CP‐ABE models face challenges related to revocation efficiency, access policy exposure, and computational burden on data owners (DOs). Even though several research works have extensively tackled this issue, most rely on re‐encryption or ciphertext updates and outsourcing strategies to proxies. However, optimization for querying all affected ciphertexts to reduce re‐encryption/ciphertext update costs is often overlooked, and the cost associated with frequent blockchain transactions for ciphertext updates and revocation records has not been addressed. Furthermore, most works do not support both attribute and user revocation efficiently. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced revocable CP‐ABE‐based access control scheme with optimized revocation performance (R‐CP‐ABE‐ORP). This scheme integrates ciphertext aggregation, lazy re‐encryption with revocation tokens, proxy‐assisted lightweight re‐encryption (PRE‐LR), blockchain, and bloom filters for fast queries to significantly improve revocation efficiency.

{"id": "scholar_67b951203e4a3e0f2968ff9f2ac414a1", "title": "Relational Processing of Tensor Programs", "authors": ["TM Serrano"], "summary": "Diverse data science applications [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] require the ability to operate over numerical arrays that have more than two dimensions, commonly known as tensors. Motivated by this necessity, in recent years there has been an emergence of tensor compilers such as TACO [9], Finch [18], Halide [11] and ExTensor [12], as well as declarative frameworks like Galley [13].\nIn addition, real-world numerical data is sparse: tensors with predominantly zero entries. Similarly, relational data is stored sparsely: only relevant tuples are materialized. For this reason, relational query engines arise as a natural candidate to process tensor workloads, since they are inherently sparse-oriented, performing computation only over existing tuples. The systems mentioned above extend array programming (eg, NumPy [14] and Py-Torch [15]) to sparse data, supporting arbitrary user-defined pointwise functions and aggregates. With the exception of Galley, these compilers focus on systematically optimizing the computation tensor kernels, not arbitrary tensor expressions. Tensor kernels are common tensor expressions that arise in different contexts and work as building blocks for tensor-based algorithms.

This study aims to conduct a comparative performance analysis between PostgreSQL 16 and MongoDB 8.0 in the context of implementing big data analytics in the retail industry. An experimental quantitative approach is used, utilizing a large-scale, real-world retail sales and inventory dataset to benchmark PostgreSQL 16 and MongoDB 8.0 across a range of representative analytical workloads. Results show MongoDB is 28-31% faster in query processing, but PostgreSQL is 13-17% more efficient in resource usage (CPU, RAM, Storage I/O) and requires 6x less storage. These results indicate that MongoDB consistently achieves faster execution times for read-intensive analytical queries, especially in large-scale aggregation operations. Conversely, PostgreSQL exhibits superior storage efficiency and lower computational resource consumption due to its normalized relational architecture. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between analytical speed and infrastructure efficiency in retail big data systems.

Traditional diagnostic methods have limitations in their ability to predict CAD accurately, which has led to the adoption of machine learning (ML) models for enhancing prediction accuracy. Among these, ensemble learning methods have shown considerable promise by combining multiple classifiers to boost the overall performance and address the complex nature of CAD prediction. Ensemble techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking improve model robustness and generalization. In this review, we explore various contemporary state-of-the-art algorithms used for CAD prediction, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). We compare the performance of these models with ensemble learning methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in clinical settings. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of feature selection techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which enhance model accuracy by eliminating irrelevant attributes. The proposed ensemble method achieved 92.5% accuracy and 0.89 AUC, outperforming traditional models by 5–7%. We also emphasize the challenges associated with ensemble models, including computational cost, model interpretability, and data imbalance, which often occurs in medical datasets. Furthermore, the review provides insights into the integration of ensemble learning models into healthcare systems and their potential for improving early CAD diagnosis and patient outcomes.

In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in petroleum geological theories, particularly in hydrocarbon accumulation dynamics, reservoir structural evolution, fluid migration mechanisms, and multi-scale structural analysis, providing new scientific foundations for the prediction, evaluation, and precise development of oil and gas under complex geological conditions. Meanwhile, continuous breakthroughs in drilling and completion, hydraulic fracturing, deep-sea drilling, and intelligent production technologies have enabled safe and efficient operations under high-temperature, high-pressure, high-stress, and strongly heterogeneous environments. However, challenges such as multi-field coupling effects in deep formations, intensified reservoir heterogeneity, engineering risks under extreme conditions, and the dual constraints of economic feasibility and carbon reduction remain critical barriers to sustainable development in this field. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in geological theories and engineering technologies for deep, ultradeep, and deep-sea oil and gas exploration and development, analyzes the key challenges currently faced, and proposes strategic directions for future research, including the integrated enhancement of geological theory systems and the synergistic innovation of intelligent and green engineering technologies.

Luo et al.", "authors": ["F Luo", "H Lan", "H Luo", "Z Bao", "JS Culpepper", "S Sadiq…"], "summary": "Missing values in tabular data lakes can severely impact data analysis and diminish the performance in downstream applications. We highlight that a robust imputation strategy should properly take three aspects of variety into consideration: source of imputed value, the types of tables involved, and the data types of the missing value. Existing imputation methods rely on estimation-based approaches (using a model trained on data from the same table to estimate missing values) or search-based approaches (retrieving values from other tables). Unfortunately, none of these approaches effectively incorporate all three aspects of variety. To address this gap, we propose CESID, a novel framework that uses a Combination of Estimation-based and Search-based methods for missing value Imputation in Data lakes. CESID contains three core modules: (1) the Contextual Search Module, which efficiently discovers candidate values from tables by exploiting the contextual information; (2) the Acquisition-guided Estimation Module, which introduces an influence function and a sampling-based exploration strategy to yield accurate estimated values; (3) the Classifier Module, which determines the most suitable method based on table-level and column-level statistics. Extensive experiments conducted on three data lakes demonstrate that CESID effectively and efficiently addresses the missing value problem.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-025-00957-1&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4606946733610701853&ei=H3ByaebiO_OlieoPkILrwAk&scisig=AHkA5jSP3th-QnoRoXa_mamsssfF&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-025-00957-1&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4606946733610701853&ei=H3ByaebiO_OlieoPkILrwAk&scisig=AHkA5jSP3th-QnoRoXa_mamsssfF&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | F Luo, H Lan, H Luo, Z Bao, JS Culpepper, S Sadiq… - The VLDB Journal, 2026 - Springer", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-025-00957-1", "scholar_enhanced": true}

To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding confidence and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a confidence-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. This design enables effective bidirectional information flow within the decoding window without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.39% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 9.0%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02076&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=1915482236404124982&ei=H3ByaebiO_OlieoPkILrwAk&scisig=AHkA5jSIfa7a_J_3aEFHUin_0Jpv&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02076&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=1915482236404124982&ei=H3ByaebiO_OlieoPkILrwAk&scisig=AHkA5jSIfa7a_J_3aEFHUin_0Jpv&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Y Shu, Y Tian, C Xu, Y Wang, H Chen - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.02076, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02076", "scholar_enhanced": true}
