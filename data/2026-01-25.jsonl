Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language. NL4ST features a three-layer architecture: (i) knowledge base and corpus for knowledge preparation, (ii) natural language understanding for entity linking, and (iii) generating physical plans. Our demonstration will showcase how NL4ST provides effective spatio-temporal physical plans, verified by using four real and synthetic datasets. We make NL4ST online and provide the demo video at https://youtu.be/-J1R7R5WoqQ."}

Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.

While static algorithms are inefficient due to full re-execution, incremental algorithms suffer from severe performance and memory bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EAIFD, a novel algorithm for incremental FD discovery. EAIFD maintains the partial hypergraph of difference sets and reframes the incremental FD discovery problem into minimal hitting set enumeration on hypergraph, avoiding full re-runs. EAIFD introduces two key innovations. First, a multi-attribute hash table ($MHT$) is devised for high-frequency key-value mappings of valid FDs, whose memory consumption is proven to be independent of the dataset size. Second, two-step validation strategy is developed to efficiently validate the enumerated candidates, which leverages $MHT$ to effectively reduce the validation space and then selectively loads data blocks for batch validation of remaining candidates, effectively avoiding repeated I/O operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of EAIFD. Compared to existing algorithms, EAIFD achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in runtime while reducing memory usage by over two orders-of-magnitude, establishing it as a highly efficient and scalable solution for incremental FD discovery."}

Traditional query rewriting approaches perform language-equivalent transformations based on manually predefined rewriting rules, thereby failing to fully harness the potential of Materialized Views (MVs) for query optimization. Furthermore, with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), natural language interaction with LLMs can better unlock the potential of MVs in query rewriting. Nevertheless, the direct application of LLMs for query rewriting exhibits several limitations, including overreliance on predefined rules, inadequate accuracy in complex tasks, and insufficient utilization of MVs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a prototype system called LLM-MVs, which leverages natural language processing with LLMs to generate and select MVs.

As data volumes grow and workloads become more complex, these problems have become exponentially harder to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, especially quantum annealing, is a promising paradigm that can efficiently explore very large search spaces through quantum tunneling. It can escape local optima by tunneling through energy barriers rather than climbing over them. Earlier works mainly focused on providing an abstract representation (e.g., Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)) for the database optimization problems (e.g., join order) and overlooked the real integration within database systems due to the high overhead of quantum computing services (e.g., a minimum 5s runtime for D-Wave's CQM-Solver). Recently, quantum annealing providers have offered more low-latency solutions, e.g., NL-Solver, which paves the road to actually realizing quantum solutions within DBMSs. However, this raises new systems research challenges in balancing efficiency and solution quality. In this talk, we show that this balance is possible to achieve. As a proof of concept, we present Q2O, the first real Quantum-augmented Query Optimizer. We show the end-to-end workflow: we encode the join order problem as a nonlinear model, a format solvable by the NL-Solver, using actual database statistics; the solution is translated into a plan hint that guides PostgreSQL's optimizer to produce a complete plan.

Both academia and industry are dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of blockchain-based supply chain traceability queries.

To address the characteristics of supply chain data, this paper proposes a dual-layer index optimized for spatiotemporal keyword transaction queries. This structure consists of an improved block header that integrates time-range labels and Bloom filters, and a Merkle Semantic B + Tree Index (MSBTree) that combines the core features of Merkle trees, B+ trees, and Bloom filters. The improved block header enables rapid coarse-grained filtering across blocks, which reduces redundant traversal. The MSB-Tree accelerates precise transaction retrieval within blocks.

Existing methods mainly targeted B-tree-based systems, where costs and cardinality are highly correlated. However, LSM-Trees, due to their unique storage structure, violate the assumptions of existing learning methods, causing cardinality to be irrelevant to cost estimation. In addition, the constantly changing data layout leads to severe data drifts when updating data, preventing current learning-based models from accurately estimating costs in an agile way. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer end-to-end cost estimation model for LSM-Tree-based database systems. This model treats cost estimation as a regression problem and comprises two layers: the storage layer and the query plan layer. The storage layer employs lightweight neural networks to leverage data distribution, provide information to the query plan layer, and address the challenges posed by data drift in LSM-Trees. The query plan layer uses the Transformer framework and incorporates structural information to learn the representation of plans. This dual-layer architecture allows our model to effectively embed storage information and query plan tree details.

A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent focuses on minimizing operating cost, while a Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) agent targets carbon emission reduction; their actions are combined through an adaptive weighting strategy. The framework is supported by carbon emission flow (CEF) theory, which enables network-level tracing of carbon flows, and a stepped carbon pricing mechanism that internalizes dynamic carbon costs.

Although research in this area has accelerated, reproducible evaluation, leak-proof validation, and cost-aware deployment are inconsistently addressed, limiting practical impact. A dual-reviewer Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was applied across IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, SSRN, and the ACM Digital Library to screen studies on equity forecasting using Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV), returns, and volatility. The review synthesizes model families and features, normalizes evaluation practices around rolling-origin, walk-forward, and embargoed splits, and appraises deployment realism via transaction costs, slippage, order execution logic, latency, and capacity constraints. Outcomes highlight recurrent risks: split leakage, lookahead in indicator computation, weak or absent baselines, omission of costs, and sparse external or cross-market tests; under these controls, deep learning often fails to dominate simpler machine learning alternatives, and feature engineering with rigorous leakage control frequently determines success. The study standardizes primary metrics including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and directional accuracy, and recommends statistical testing via the Superior Predictive Ability (SPA) test with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. The contribution is a taxonomy linking methods, markets, and evaluation outcomes, together with a deploymentaware reporting framework that specifies leakage controls, cost modeling, latency, and capacity indicators.

However, training AI models in these environments often faces privacy concerns and limited labeled data. Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving solution by allowing clients to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. Yet, FL still struggles with the scarcity of labeled data due to privacy constraints. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can alleviate this issue by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. While combining SSL and FL (FSSL) offers promise, it also introduces new challenges, such as confirmation bias and degraded performance under non-IID data distributions. Most existing FSSL methods assume uniform labeling capabilities across clients, which is rarely the case in practice. This leads to a new challenge only occur in FSSL called annotation heterogeneity, where some clients have many labeled samples while others have few or none. When combined with data heterogeneity, this dual-data heterogeneity (data and annotation heterogeneity) severely affects global model performance. Therefore, FSSL must learn under label scarcity while preserving privacy, remain stable when non-IID data is compounded by annotation heterogeneity, and stay communication-efficient for mobile deployment. In this work, we propose Federated Fisher Focus Filtering (FedF3), an enhanced framework built upon our previous SynFMPL method, to address the combination effect of dual-data heterogeneity. FedF3 introduces a two-stage strategy, Adaptive Loss Filtering stabilizes early training by suppressing unreliable contributions under dual heterogeneity, and Fisher Focus Selection preserves accuracy with Fisher-guided sparsity to meet communication budgets. Our method demonstrates robust performance improvements across diverse and heterogeneous FL settings, mitigating the negative effects of dual-data heterogeneity while preserving personalization and privacy.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11295951/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=2298681466154420481&ei=fM90aY31NcyQieoPxcX9yAo&scisig=AHkA5jTnyP15FgUiA1mFf_sgHaj-&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11295951/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=2298681466154420481&ei=fM90aY31NcyQieoPxcX9yAo&scisig=AHkA5jTnyP15FgUiA1mFf_sgHaj-&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=3&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | TH Peng, WC Tai, YH Chiang, Y Ji… - IEEE Transactions on …, 2025 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11295951/", "scholar_enhanced": true}

However, the massive raw sensory data generated by UAVs can easily overwhelm bandwidth-limited communication infrastructures, undermining the timeliness and reliability of disaster response. To address this challenge, we propose a cloud-edge-end collaborative semantic communication(SemCom) framework that enables UAVs, mobile edge vehicles, and cloud-based command centers to jointly deliver resilient and scalable AIoT services. In this architecture, UAVs perform real-time environmental sensing, vehicles act as mobile edge nodes for semantic filtering and resource coordination, while the cloud executes global decision-making. To optimize semantic data trading under incomplete information, we integrate matching theory with a multi-armed bandit (MAB) model and design a Matching-UCB algorithm, which allows UAVs and vehicles to dynamically learn preferences through repeated interactions. Theoretical analysis proves that Matching-UCB achieves sub-linear regret and guarantees stable matching outcomes.

To this end, we propose a multi-agent prompt optimization framework in which language-model agents jointly propose feature definitions, extract feature values, and evaluate feature quality using dataset-level performance and interpretability feedback. Instruction prompts are iteratively refined based on this structured feedback, enabling optimization over prompts that induce shared feature sets rather than per-example predictions.

A recent trend is to develop RL systems with a fully disaggregated architecture, which decouples the three RL phases (rollout, reward, and training) onto separate resources and executes them asynchronously. However, two critical data-level concerns arise: (1) asynchronous execution leads to data staleness in trajectories (the data generated by rollout) as the model parameters used in rollout may not be up to date, which impairs RL convergence; and (2) the length variation of trajectories introduces severe data skewness, leading to workload imbalance and degraded system performance. Existing systems fail to address these two concerns in a unified manner. Techniques that tightly control data staleness often constrain effective data skewness mitigation, while aggressive data skewness mitigation tends to exacerbate data staleness. As a result, systems are forced to trade off convergence for performance, or vice versa. To address this, we propose StaleFlow, an RL post-training system that jointly tackles data staleness and skewness. First, to control staleness, StaleFlow introduces a global consistency protocol that tracks the full lifecycle of each trajectory and constrains staleness. Second, to mitigate skewness, StaleFlow re-designs the RL system architecture by constructing data servers for trajectories and parameters to achieve flexible rollout coordination. Subsequently, we develop a suite of staleness-aware, throughput-oriented strategies to enhance system performance. Evaluations show that StaleFlow achieves up to 1.42-2.68 (1.17-2.01 on average) higher throughput than state-of-the-art systems, without compromising convergence.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12784&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=1183535510241298154&ei=fM90aY31NcyQieoPxcX9yAo&scisig=AHkA5jRfiGFFOVLPrL7Msaet5Wo0&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=8&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12784&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=1183535510241298154&ei=fM90aY31NcyQieoPxcX9yAo&scisig=AHkA5jRfiGFFOVLPrL7Msaet5Wo0&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=8&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | H Li, S Lin, F Fu, Y Zhou, X Ji, Y Zhao, L Wang… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12784", "scholar_enhanced": true}

In parallel, submodular and combinatorial information measures (SIMs) have recently been proposed as a principled framework for extending entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information to general submodular functions, and have been used extensively in data subset selection, active learning, domain adaptation, and representation learning. This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications.", "categories": ["Google Scholar"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12724&hl=en&sa=X&d=2298347721120755187&ei=fkp1ac2bCLuM6rQP2dOq-Ag&scisig=AHkA5jTYHfVedb5vgco4-iTNwb7D&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12724&hl=en&sa=X&d=2298347721120755187&ei=fkp1ac2bCLuM6rQP2dOq-Ag&scisig=AHkA5jTYHfVedb5vgco4-iTNwb7D&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:6303853285888070373:AHkA5jQg0xFJQ1T_sclEfqikcIfn&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | R Iyer - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.12724, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12724", "scholar_enhanced": true}

As data volumes grow and workloads become more complex, these problems have become exponentially harder to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, especially quantum annealing, is a promising paradigm that can efficiently explore very large search spaces through quantum tunneling. It can escape local optima by tunneling through energy barriers rather than climbing over them. Earlier works mainly focused on providing an abstract representation (e.g., Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)) for the database optimization problems (e.g., join order) and overlooked the real integration within database systems due to the high overhead of quantum computing services (e.g., a minimum 5s runtime for D-Wave's CQM-Solver). Recently, quantum annealing providers have offered more low-latency solutions, e.g., NL-Solver, which paves the road to actually realizing quantum solutions within DBMSs. However, this raises new systems research challenges in balancing efficiency and solution quality. In this talk, we show that this balance is possible to achieve. As a proof of concept, we present Q2O, the first real Quantum-augmented Query Optimizer. We show the end-to-end workflow: we encode the join order problem as a nonlinear model, a format solvable by the NL-Solver, using actual database statistics; the solution is translated into a plan hint that guides PostgreSQL's optimizer to produce a complete plan. Q2O is capable of handling actual queries in real time.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12123&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=9285225533576205973&ei=fkp1aeqDJ9_YieoP1b6liQE&scisig=AHkA5jRDfK0IRE9TLF2LMuEpLbGM&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12123&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=9285225533576205973&ei=fkp1aeqDJ9_YieoP1b6liQE&scisig=AHkA5jRDfK0IRE9TLF2LMuEpLbGM&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | H Liu, I Sabek - arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.12123, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12123", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Existing methods mainly targeted B-tree-based systems, where costs and cardinality are highly correlated. However, LSM-Trees, due to their unique storage structure, violate the assumptions of existing learning methods, causing cardinality to be irrelevant to cost estimation. In addition, the constantly changing data layout leads to severe data drifts when updating data, preventing current learning-based models from accurately estimating costs in an agile way. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer end-to-end cost estimation model for LSM-Tree-based database systems. This model treats cost estimation as a regression problem and comprises two layers: the storage layer and the query plan layer. The storage layer employs lightweight neural networks to leverage data distribution, provide information to the query plan layer, and address the challenges posed by data drift in LSM-Trees. The query plan layer uses the Transformer framework and incorporates structural information to learn the representation of plans. This dual-layer architecture allows our model to effectively embed storage information and query plan tree details. The results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art cost estimation accuracy for database systems based on LSM-Trees. Additionally, our architecture significantly reduces the model’s updating costs, ensuring robust performance amid frequent data drifts.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11291109/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8781029551153413101&ei=fUp1aZqMNbui6rQPrda9qQc&scisig=AHkA5jSUyfwPqJ7biiYoxPo3Ey2P&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:5415062280803925783:AHkA5jRE4TteOSij5hC2af6T5WUE&html=&pos=0&folt=cit", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11291109/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8781029551153413101&ei=fUp1aZqMNbui6rQPrda9qQc&scisig=AHkA5jSUyfwPqJ7biiYoxPo3Ey2P&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:5415062280803925783:AHkA5jRE4TteOSij5hC2af6T5WUE&html=&pos=0&folt=cit", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | Y Jing, S Wang, Z He, K Zhang… - IEEE Transactions on …, 2025 - ieeexplore.ieee.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11291109/", "scholar_enhanced": true}
