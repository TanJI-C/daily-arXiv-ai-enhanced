Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \\ldots, k_{\\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{\\ell}$ such that for all $i \\in [\\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \\leq k_i$ and for all $i \\neq j$, $S_i \\cap S_j=\\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u724c\u5e7f\u544a\u6295\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u5171\u4eab\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u4e92\u65a5\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u5b50\u6a21\u8986\u76d6\u53ca\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u8d2a\u5fc3\u548c\u968f\u673a\u820d\u5165\u7684\u53cc\u51c6\u5219\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u724c\u5e7f\u544a\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u5e38\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u5e7f\u591a\u4e2a\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u79cd\u4ea7\u54c1\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\u4e0b\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u5b50\u6a21\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u820d\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u51c6\u5219\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e92\u65a5\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5e7f\u544a\u724c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u5e7f\u544a\u724c\u5e7f\u544a\u6295\u653e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5546\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6237\u5916\u5e7f\u544a\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
