Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \\ldots, k_{\\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{\\ell}$ such that for all $i \\in [\\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \\leq k_i$ and for all $i \\neq j$, $S_i \\cap S_j=\\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches."}

Optimus expands the action space itself by mining novel execution plan rewrites and learns to select among these actions online. Optimus utilizes graph-based inductive matrix completion and a multilayer perceptron with the objective of minimizing latency. Crucially, the system is deployable by design: it requires no engine modifications and its rules include guard-checked compilation. On the extended JOB benchmark, Optimus yields a speedup of 1.16x over vanilla PostgreSQL solely using novel rewrites.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://openreview.net/pdf%3Fid%3DZVzYv7Qois&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8376193066075901600&ei=nwRxaby5HPStieoP-8T7kA0&scisig=AHkA5jS9_FfixoqCddZw8Pcingt6&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://openreview.net/pdf%3Fid%3DZVzYv7Qois&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=8376193066075901600&ei=nwRxaby5HPStieoP-8T7kA0&scisig=AHkA5jS9_FfixoqCddZw8Pcingt6&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | R Lone - 4th Deployable AI Workshop, 2026 - openreview.net", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZVzYv7Qois", "scholar_enhanced": true}
