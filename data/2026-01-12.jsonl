To handle spatial data, many data structures, called spatial indexes, have been proposed, e.g. kd-trees, oct/quadtrees (also called Orth-trees), R-trees, and bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs). In real-world applications, spatial datasets tend to be highly dynamic, requiring batch updates of points with low latency. This calls for efficient parallel batch updates on spatial indexes. Unfortunately, there is very little work that achieves this.\n  In this paper, we systematically study parallel spatial indexes, with a special focus on achieving high-performance update performance for highly dynamic workloads. We select two types of spatial indexes that are considered optimized for low-latency updates: Orth-tree and R-tree/BVH. We propose two data structures: the P-Orth tree, a parallel Orth-tree, and the SPaC-tree family, a parallel R-tree/BVH. Both the P-Orth tree and the SPaC-tree deliver superior performance in batch updates compared to existing parallel kd-trees and Orth-trees, while preserving better or competitive query performance relative to their corresponding Orth-tree and R-tree counterparts. We also present comprehensive experiments comparing the performance of various parallel spatial indexes and share our findings at the end of the paper."}

Users can express an operation in natural language (e.g., \"identify if this review mentions billing issues\"), with the system executing the operation on each document, in a row-by-row fashion. One way to reduce cost on a batch of documents is to employ the model cascade framework: a cheap proxy model processes each document, and only uncertain cases are escalated to a more accurate, expensive oracle. However, model cascades miss important optimization opportunities; for example, often only part of a document is needed to answer a query, or other related, but simpler operations (e.g., \"is the review sentiment negative?\", \"does the review mention money?\") can be handled by cheap models more effectively than the original operation, while still being correlated with it.\n  We introduce the task cascades framework, which generalizes model cascades by varying not just the model, but also the document portion and operation at each stage. Our framework uses an LLM agent to generate simplified, decomposed, or otherwise related operations and selects the most relevant document portions, constructing hundreds of candidate tasks from which it assembles a task cascade. We show that optimal cascade selection is intractable via reduction from Minimum Sum Set Cover, but our iterative approach constructs effective cascades. We also provide an extension that offers statistical accuracy guarantees: the resulting cascade meets a user-defined accuracy target (with respect to the oracle) up to a bounded failure probability. Across eight real-world document processing tasks at a 90% target accuracy, task cascades reduce end-to-end cost by an average of 36% compared to model cascades, at a production scale."}

Traditional SQL dialect translation tools rely on manually-crafted rules, necessitating significant manual effort to support new RDBMSs and dialects. Although large language models (LLMs) can assist in translating SQL dialects, they often struggle with lengthy and complex SQL queries.\n  In this paper, we propose RISE, a novel LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that can accurately handle lengthy and complex SQL queries. Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy. RISE achieves accuracies of 97.98% on TPC-DS and 100% on SQLProcBench, outperforming the baselines by an average improvement of 24.62% and 238.41%, respectively."}

Collected over a continuous 72-hour window (June 9 to 11, 2025) on Microsoft Azure, the dataset comprises 132,425 individual attack events captured by three honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea, and SentryPeer) deployed across four geographically dispersed virtual machines. Each event record includes enriched metadata (UTC timestamps, source/destination IPs, autonomous system and organizational mappings, geolocation coordinates, targeted ports, and honeypot identifiers alongside derived temporal features and standardized protocol classifications). We provide actionable guidance for researchers seeking to leverage this dataset in anomaly detection, protocol-misuse studies, threat intelligence, and defensive policy design. Descriptive statistics highlight significant skew: 2,438 unique source IPs span 95 countries, yet the top 1% of IPs account for 1% of all events, and three protocols dominate: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Telnet, Server Message Block (SMB). Temporal analysis uncovers pronounced rush-hour peaks at 07:00 and 23:00 UTC, interspersed with maintenance-induced gaps that reveal operational blind spots. Geospatial mapping further underscores platform-specific biases: SentryPeer captures concentrated SIP floods in North America and Southeast Asia, Cowrie logs Telnet/SSH scans predominantly from Western Europe and the U.S., and Dionaea records SMB exploits around European nodes. By combining fine-grained temporal resolution with rich, contextual geolocation and protocol metadata, this standalone dataset aims to empower reproducible, cloud-scale investigations into evolving cyber threats. Accompanying analysis code and data access details are provided."}

To address such an explanation question about a ranking function, we investigate the computation of SHAP scores for column weights, adopting a recent framework by Grohe et al.[ICDT'24]. The exact definition of this score depends on three key components: (1) the ranking function in use, (2) an effect function that quantifies the impact of using alternative weights on the ranking, and (3) an underlying weight distribution. We analyze the computational complexity of different instantiations of this framework for a range of fundamental ranking and effect functions, focusing on probabilistically independent finite distributions for individual columns.\n  For the ranking functions, we examine lexicographic orders and score-based orders defined by the summation, minimum, and maximum functions. For the effect functions, we consider global, top-k, and local perspectives: global measures quantify the divergence between the perturbed and original rankings, top-k measures inspect the change in the set of top-k answers, and local measures capture the impact on an individual tuple of interest. Although all cases admit an additive fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), we establish the complexity of exact computation, identifying which cases are solvable in polynomial time and which are #P-hard. We further show that all complexity results, lower bounds and upper bounds, extend to a related task of computing the Shapley value of whole columns (regardless of their weight)."}
