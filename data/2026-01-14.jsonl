A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer \"why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL. Viewed abstractly, CSQL functions as a compiler from unstructured documents into a causal database equipped with a principled algebra of queries, and can be applied broadly across many domains ranging from business, humanities, and science."}

With the rapid growth of vector data, efficient indexing for real-time vector search has become rudimentary. Existing CPU-based solutions support updates but suffer from low throughput, while GPU-accelerated systems deliver high performance but face challenges with dynamic updates and limited GPU memory, resulting in a critical performance gap for continuous, large-scale vector search requiring both accuracy and speed. In this paper, we present SVFusion, a GPU-CPU-disk collaborative framework for real-time vector search that bridges sophisticated GPU computation with online updates. SVFusion leverages a hierarchical vector index architecture that employs CPU-GPU co-processing, along with a workload-aware vector caching mechanism to maximize the efficiency of limited GPU memory. It further enhances performance through real-time coordination with CUDA multi-stream optimization and adaptive resource management, along with concurrency control that ensures data consistency under interleaved queries and updates. Empirical results demonstrate that SVFusion achieves significant improvements in query latency and throughput, exhibiting a 20.9x higher throughput on average and 1.3x to 50.7x lower latency compared to baseline methods, while maintaining high recall for large-scale datasets under various streaming workloads."}

This study addresses this gap by examining an innovative, low-cost strategy. Introduction This research describes a literacy learning strategy using a'Class Literacy Tree'(POLIKEL) to support the'One Week One Book'(SAMI SAKU) program and its impact on the reading interest and literacy skills of fifth-grade elementary students. Method A qualitative, descriptive case study design was employed at two elementary schools in Sumedang Regency, Indonesia. Data were collected via observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation analysis, then analyzed using an interactive model. Results The'Class Literacy Tree'strategy successfully creates a joyful, participatory, and goal-oriented learning environment. The program effectively fosters continuous reading and writing habits, with teachers acting as crucial facilitators. Students' consistent, tangible engagement with the'tree'demonstrated marked improvement in reading interest, comprehension of intrinsic text elements, and basic writing skills. Discussion The strategy's success is contingent on a supporting management cycle strong school leadership, validating the PDCA cycle as a framework for sustainable pedagogical innovation. This strategy serves as an effective, sustainable, and scalable alternative model to enhance foundational literacy in elementary education.\n\n\n\n", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://jse.rezkimedia.org/index.php/jse/article/download/707/258&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=2159830123818094372&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jReZdsox4Zw76HkptOp1z7O&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://jse.rezkimedia.org/index.php/jse/article/download/707/258&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=2159830123818094372&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jReZdsox4Zw76HkptOp1z7O&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=1&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | N Sumartina, H Hidayat - Journal of Science and Education (JSE …, 2026 - jse.rezkimedia.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://jse.rezkimedia.org/index.php/jse/article/view/707", "scholar_enhanced": true}

Despite its widespread use, ROC-AUC can mask operationally salient differences among classifiers when the costs of false positives and false negatives are asymmetric. Using three benchmarks, credit-card fraud detection (0.17%), yeast protein localization (1.35%), and ozone level detection (2.9%), we compare ROC-AUC with Matthews Correlation Coefficient, F2-score, H-measure, and PR-AUC. Our empirical analyses span 20 classifier–sampler configurations per dataset, combined with four classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost) and four oversampling methods plus a no-resampling baseline (no resampling, SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE, ADASYN). ROC-AUC exhibits pronounced ceiling effects, yielding high scores even for underperforming models. In contrast, MCC and F2 align more closely with deployment-relevant costs and achieve the highest Kendall’s τ rank concordance across datasets; PR-AUC provides threshold-independent ranking, and H-measure integrates cost sensitivity. We quantify uncertainty and differences using stratified bootstrap confidence intervals, DeLong’s test for ROC-AUC, and Friedman–Nemenyi critical-difference diagrams, which collectively underscore the limited discriminative value of ROC-AUC in rare-event settings. The findings recommend a shift to a multi-metric evaluation framework: ROC-AUC should not be used as the primary metric in ultra-imbalanced settings; instead, MCC and F2 are recommended as primary indicators, supplemented by PR-AUC and H-measure where ranking granularity and principled cost integration are required. This evidence encourages researchers and practitioners to move beyond sole reliance on ROC-AUC when evaluating classifiers in highly imbalanced data.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/14/1/54&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=16634368780685530853&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jTxcQJBybGn_AeawWSolN60&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=2&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/14/1/54&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=16634368780685530853&ei=hKtlae3BJbK16rQPitqooQg&scisig=AHkA5jTxcQJBybGn_AeawWSolN60&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=2&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | M Imani, M Joudaki, A Bagheri, HR Arabnia - Technologies, 2026 - mdpi.com", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/14/1/54", "scholar_enhanced": true}

A comprehensive tool is developed, combining long-term scenario generation using the TimeGAN deep learning model with multi-objective stochastic optimization of the energy system. To address TimeGAN’s limitations on long sequences, a dedicated preprocessing step based on frequency decomposition is introduced, enabling the capture of multi-scale patterns in climatic and consumption data. The generated synthetic scenarios are rigorously validated using statistical and spectral criteria, and are then used as inputs for the sizing phase.

However, when dealing with such large datasets, the query efficiency and performance of the system become key factors that constrain its response speed and accuracy. This study analyzed the key performance bottlenecks of distributed data queries, such as storage response latency, hardware processing capacity limits, and data consistency assurance. Based on this, a series of targeted improvement measures were proposed. Specifically, in terms of distributed storage network latency, hardware resource upgrade requirements, and data consistency maintenance, research has proposed solutions such as optimizing data distribution, regularly upgrading hardware facilities, and adopting distributed locking strategies. After implementing these optimization measures, query response can be accelerated, data accuracy can be ensured, and hardware costs and maintenance expenses can be reduced.
