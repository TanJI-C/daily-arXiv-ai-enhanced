GRANII executes in two stages:(1) an offline compilation stage that enumerates all valid re-associations leading to different sparse-dense matrix compositions and uses inputoblivious pruning techniques to prune away clearly unprofitable candidates, and (2) an online runtime system that explores the remaining candidates and uses light-weight cost models to select the best re-association based on the input graph and the embedding sizes.

We propose a conceptual architecture for hint based query optimization and describe two modules in detail: a fast module which encodes physical plans as text, embeds with a pretrained language model, retrieves nearest neighbors, and produces a compact binary hint vector with a safety check against the default plan; and an agent guided module powered by a fine tuned Large Language Model, which refines hints through iterative search with database feedback under a strict evaluation budget. We specify interfaces, data flow, and decision policies for both modules, and outline integration through standard hint mechanisms without engine changes. Preliminary module level results on JOB CEB indicate roughly twenty percent average runtime reduction for the fast module and fewer trial executions than a greedy baseline for the agent guided module. The paper focuses on architecture and module behavior rather than a single end to end deployment, so system wide testing is intentionally out of scope.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikita-Vasilenko-5/publication/398845655_Hint_Based_Query_Optimization_with_LLM_Agent_and_Plan_Similarity/links/69461f6c27359023a00e42b0/Hint-Based-Query-Optimization-with-LLM-Agent-and-Plan-Similarity.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=11322770814657841974&ei=VjRvaZepE5Sw6rQPxrTySQ&scisig=AHkA5jTWTluCMyndgUwojVgLjKLT&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikita-Vasilenko-5/publication/398845655_Hint_Based_Query_Optimization_with_LLM_Agent_and_Plan_Similarity/links/69461f6c27359023a00e42b0/Hint-Based-Query-Optimization-with-LLM-Agent-and-Plan-Similarity.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=11322770814657841974&ei=VjRvaZepE5Sw6rQPxrTySQ&scisig=AHkA5jTWTluCMyndgUwojVgLjKLT&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=0&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | N Vasilenko, A Demin, V Burlakov - 2025 IEEE XVII International \u2026, 2025 - researchgate.net", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikita-Vasilenko-5/publication/398845655_Hint_Based_Query_Optimization_with_LLM_Agent_and_Plan_Similarity/links/69461f6c27359023a00e42b0/Hint-Based-Query-Optimization-with-LLM-Agent-and-Plan-Similarity.pdf", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\uff08hint-based\uff09\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u793a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u522b\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea620%\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8bd5\u9519\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u4ef7\u7684SQL\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u6216\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u68c0\u7d22\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u5b89\u5168\u6821\u9a8c\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u5411\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u5728JOB CEB\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u5757\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea620%\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8bd5\u9519\u6267\u884c\u6b21\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7559\u4f5c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Indeed, this is analogous to the role of SQL for relational databases. Unlike SQL, however, fundamental problems regarding GQL are still unsolved, most notably the complexity of query evaluation. In this paper we provide a complete solution to this problem for the core fragment of GQL and for its extension with path restrictors. In particular, we show that the data complexity of these fragments is P^NP[log]-complete in general, and drops to NL-complete when restrictors are disallowed. Using techniques from embedded finite model theory, we show that this is true, even when the queries use data from infinite concrete domains such as real numbers with arithmetic. In proving these results, we establish and exploit tight connections between GQL and query languages over relational databases, especially extensions of relational calculus with transitive closure operators and fragments of second-order logic.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://hal.science/hal-05462926/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13181890233502293177&ei=VjRvaZepE5Sw6rQPxrTySQ&scisig=AHkA5jQ1oRfmaxjV5ti4lWHhTpv2&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://hal.science/hal-05462926/&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=13181890233502293177&ei=VjRvaZepE5Sw6rQPxrTySQ&scisig=AHkA5jQ1oRfmaxjV5ti4lWHhTpv2&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | D Figueira, A Lin, L Peterfreund - International Conference on Database \u2026, 2026 - hal.science", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://hal.science/hal-05462926/", "scholar_enhanced": true, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00GQL\u6838\u5fc3\u7247\u6bb5\u53ca\u5176\u5e26\u8def\u5f84\u9650\u5236\u7b26\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1a\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3aP^NP[log]-\u5b8c\u5168\uff0c\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u7b26\u65f6\u964d\u4e3aNL-\u5b8c\u5168\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6d89\u53ca\u5b9e\u6570\u7b49\u65e0\u9650\u6570\u636e\u57df\u4ea6\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "motivation": "GQL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5176\u67e5\u8be2\u6c42\u503c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u8a00\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6709\u9650\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\uff08embedded finite model theory\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acbGQL\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u5e26\u4f20\u9012\u95ed\u5305\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6f14\u7b97\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7247\u6bb5\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GQL\u6838\u5fc3\u7247\u6bb5\u53ca\u5176\u5e26\u8def\u5f84\u9650\u5236\u7b26\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u522b\u4e3aNL-\u5b8c\u5168\u548cP^NP[log]-\u5b8c\u5168\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u5305\u542b\u5b9e\u6570\u7b49\u65e0\u9650\u5177\u4f53\u57df\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "GQL\u67e5\u8be2\u6c42\u503c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5df2\u5728\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}
