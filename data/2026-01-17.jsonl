STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs."}

Many resources are created using vocabularies that are FAIR-compliant and well-annotated, yet the collective ecosystem of these resources often fails to interoperate effectively in practice. This continued challenge is mainly due to variation in identifier schemas and data models used in these resources. We have created two tools to bridge the chasm between interoperability in principle and interoperation in practice. Babel solves the problem of multiple identifier schemes by producing a curated set of identifier mappings to create cliques of equivalent identifiers that are exposed through high-performance APIs. ORION solves the problems of multiple data models by ingesting knowledge bases and transforming them into a common, community-managed data model. Here, we describe Babel and ORION and demonstrate their ability to support data interoperation. A library of fully interoperable knowledge bases created through the application of Babel and ORION is available for download and use at https://robokop.renci.org."}

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods."}

Concretely, we re-write transactions to 1) merge similar statements using specific SQL semantics; 2) eliminate redundant reads; and 3) merge contending statements across transactions by pre-computing their aggregated effect. Following this idea, we present the design of TransactionMerger, a middleware to collect and merge transactions across different clients. We further present a static analysis tool to identify the merging opportunity without violating isolation as well as our experience of re-writing transactions in TPC-C and Spree, a popular real-world application. Our evaluation shows that such transaction merging can improve TPC-C throughput by up to 2.65X and Spree throughput by 3.52X."}

Motivated by this, we undertake a systematic investigation on the complexity of sampling from the result of an acyclic join under equality conditions given only at runtime. When conditions are conjunctive, the goal is to understand when it is possible to precompute a feasible structure that uses O (IN) space and supports sampling in O (1) time, where IN is the input size. We present a dichotomy to characterize (subject to a widely-accepted conjecture) the existence of such structures based on the conditions supplied and, in every feasible scenario, give an optimal structure of O (IN) space and O (1) sample time. We then extend our investigation to conditions expressed in disjunctive normal form, where the core challenge reduces to the fundamental set union sampling problem. We overcome the challenge with an optimal algorithm and utilize it to develop optimal sampling structures.

Random Forest-based meta-models achieved predictive accuracies above 90%, enabling the rapid evaluation of technical and financial trade-offs across the mining value chain. Stage-wise cost models were formulated for drilling, blasting, comminution, and material handling to link process variables to costs per tonne. The results reveal clear non-linear cost responses: finer fragmentation reduces the total comminution cost despite higher explosive expenditure, while SAG mill load and speed exhibit U-shaped cost relationships with distinct optimal operating windows. By combining physics-based simulations, machine learning, and cost integration, the framework transforms traditional stage-wise optimisation into a holistic, financially informed decision-support system.

We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation, distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost. Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning, with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability.

Existing approaches become impractical beyond ~15–20 variables, limiting IIT analyses on realistic neural and complex systems. We introduce GeoMIP, a geometric–topological framework that recasts the MIP search as a graph-based optimization problem on the n-dimensional hypercube graph: discrete system states are modeled as graph vertices, and Hamming distance adjacency defines edges and shortest-path structures. Building on a tensor-decomposed representation of the transition probabilities, GeoMIP constructs a transition-cost (ground cost) structure by dynamic programming over graph neighborhoods and BFS-like exploration by Hamming levels, exploiting hypercube symmetries to reduce redundant evaluations. We validate GeoMIP against PyPhi, ensuring reliability of MIP identification and Φ computation. Across multiple implementations, GeoMIP achieves 165–326× speedups over PyPhi while maintaining 98–100% agreement in partition identification. Heuristic extensions further enable analyses up to ~25 variables, substantially expanding the practical IIT regime. Overall, by leveraging the hypercube’s explicit graph structure (vertices, edges, shortest paths, and automorphisms), GeoMIP turns an intractable combinatorial search into a scalable graph-based procedure for IIT partitioning.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/16/2/809&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=15624358317915932604&ei=sx1qafjzNIeUywSZ68jgDw&scisig=AHkA5jREyUcBuyy_JHrp3bf5JbgZ&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/16/2/809&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=15624358317915932604&ei=sx1qafjzNIeUywSZ68jgDw&scisig=AHkA5jREyUcBuyy_JHrp3bf5JbgZ&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=5&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | J Díaz-Arancibia, LE Guerrero, J Arango-López… - Applied Sciences, 2026 - mdpi.com", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/16/2/809", "scholar_enhanced": true}

In these scenarios, the graphs are often large and dynamic, where vertices and edges are inserted and deleted frequently, so it is costly to obtain the updated communities by Leiden from scratch when the graph has changed. Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures. Comprehensive experiments in various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HIT-Leiden. In particular, it achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude over existing methods.", "categories": ["learned \"cost model\""], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08554&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=10445304588978131053&ei=sx1qafjzNIeUywSZ68jgDw&scisig=AHkA5jTs0Hw2ut028dZbVBaA7K_9&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=6&folt=kw-top", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08554&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=10445304588978131053&ei=sx1qafjzNIeUywSZ68jgDw&scisig=AHkA5jTs0Hw2ut028dZbVBaA7K_9&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:15658717702251462117:AHkA5jRs58Sh7gAGjO8tMulsiOso&html=&pos=6&folt=kw-top", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | C Lin, Y Xie, Y Fang, Y Hu, Y Hu, C Cheng - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2026 - arxiv.org", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08554", "scholar_enhanced": true}

There are clear use cases of strong requirements for privacy protection in DNN models and input data. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes provide privacy by enabling operations upon encrypted data with post-quantum security, at the expense of vast data size increase. Overwhelming execution times and memory sizes currently limit DNN inference with FHE to severely reduced models and datasets. In this article, we thoroughly review the state of the art and the state of the practice around this topic, and identify the current challenges remaining to enable efficient DNN inference with FHE in production-sized use cases, along with the most promising trends to address them. Advancing upon previous review articles in the literature, our focus is specifically on deep learning inference on top of high-performance hardware.

This counterintuitive success stems from the observation of the `Markovian' nature: advanced sequential recommenders coincidentally rely on the latest interaction to make predictions, while the historical interactions serve mainly as auxiliary cues for inferring the user's general, non-sequential identity. This characteristic necessitates the capabilities of a universal recommendation model to effectively summarize the user sequence, with particular emphasis on the latest interaction. MPT inherently has the potential to be universal and transferable. On the one hand, when trained to predict the next state of Markov chains, it acquires the capabilities to estimate transition probabilities from the context (one adaptive manner for summarizing sequences) and attend to the last state to ensure accurate state transitions. On the other hand, unlike the heterogeneous interaction data, an unlimited amount of controllable Markov chains is available to boost the model capacity.

Until recently ES had a shared-nothing architecture that relied on local disks to store cluster data such as index files, transaction logs, and cluster state metadata. In this stateful architecture, compute is coupled with storage, and this leads to different tiers (eg, hot, warm, cold, and frozen) of hardware and configurations that the administrator chooses from to balance cost, performance, and high availability. In this paper, we show the technical design of a new serverless architecture, focusing on decoupling compute from storage, and offloading data to an affordable highly available object store, while supporting the same APIs and read-after-write semantics. Specifically, we show why and how this stateless architecture simplifies the data tiers to just two: indexing and search. This architecture supports indexing and searching practically limitless data while scaling each tier independently. Furthermore, we describe how we wrap index data into a custom batch commit format onto the object store to decrease upload costs by up to 100x, how we batch transaction log uploads to decrease upload costs by up to 30x, and how we delete files from the object store. We experimentally show that Serverless ES can get twice the indexing throughput of (stateful) ES on comparable compute hardware by using cloud object storage for durability instead of replication, and can scale linearly to match ingestion workloads.", "categories": ["Ziniu Wu"], "pdf": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~brendan/papers/serverless-elasticsearch.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4663664700620309864&ei=3NlqaYuJI7ux6rQPmKbEyA4&scisig=AHkA5jQ42xzoAOOsQlkP2_egdEN7&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "abs": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~brendan/papers/serverless-elasticsearch.pdf&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&d=4663664700620309864&ei=3NlqaYuJI7ux6rQPmKbEyA4&scisig=AHkA5jQ42xzoAOOsQlkP2_egdEN7&oi=scholaralrt&hist=Pxo5FIAAAAAJ:11734074576040036222:AHkA5jT4qH64J8nZejvQlyvZo1xT&html=&pos=1&folt=rel", "comment": "From Google Scholar Alert | I Psaroudakis, P Salehi, J Bryan, FF Castaño, B Cully… - 2025 - cs.ubc.ca", "source": "Google Scholar", "url": "https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~brendan/papers/serverless-elasticsearch.pdf", "scholar_enhanced": true}
